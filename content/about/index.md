# About Me

**AlwaysNever-25**, also known as **Al**.
Born sometime after Y2K, he's a boy with no knowledge at all regarding website.
Until he did something crazy. Jumped immediately... into Wikia.

Well, he thought he did something, with uploading images of weapons from this old Zombie MMO game called *The Last Stand: Dead Zone*.
Boy howdy, bless his soul, he got sidetracked by a zombie game, for fuck's sake. Anyway.
Time flies. He go through some shit, namely, High School and College.

He sleep through class, yet somehow he ended up being the fourth best in his class by the end of the senior year? What?
Yeah, don't know how the fuck that happened. His interest piqued again as he get to edit another wiki.
A name now forgotten. He met some cool person with wizard knowledge on HTML and CSS, and a reddit moderator. Bless *his* soul.
He then learn the beautiful world of HTML and CSS, and basically, front-end development. Found some kind of purpose, but also he's still into this Wikia shit first.
After the now forgotten Wiki is abandoned, he jumped ship into other wikis. Editing like crazy.
Somehow got admin in three different wikis, even founded one of those. ~~It would've been four if he was smart enough but he's not~~

By then he already familiar with the structure of Wikia, now branded as Fandom.
He learns how to apply those pesky CSS to the whole wiki, applying script from Dev Wiki to his own, and feverishly editing like a madman to a wiki that perhaps nobody even look at.
And then you know what? He got to a bootcamp. After all that shit, he finally uses his brain and start applying those skills to a real world equivalent, not just in his brain.
Perhaps, later on, he can actually apply it to real world as well, things in his mind.
