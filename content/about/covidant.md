# The Mark of the Covidant

## What is The Mark of the Covidant?
Playing off the phrase "Mark of the Covenant", this is a series of unrelated writing written between 2021 and 2022, during what I can possibly say as the darkest period of my adult life. I'm still not sure I should post these, but do keep in mind, any edginess or angst you read from these posts are not jokes or my attempt to be funny, it's just something I had to let out because I had no one to let it out to.
