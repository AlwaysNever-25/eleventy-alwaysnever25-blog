# Two Thousand Twenty Words

## What is Two Thousand Twenty Words?

It's a project conceived by me, Al, for the year of 2020. The project was basically to **write at least two thousand words per week**. At that year, I was convinced that this could lead to a healthy habit of writing, because I believe that writing is my future. I want to start early, before I spent the majority of my 20s perfecting them.

Well, the project went well, with a few hiccups you might say... but as you know... 2020.

Everything basically kinda petered out during the first few months of the pandemic, but I stubbornly keep on doing them. At some point I was misssing basically months of writing, though. I never ended up hitting all fifty two weeks, but the project produces some kind of... window, to my thought process at the time.

## What is Weekly Review?

**Weekly Review** is a project review that I do every week during 2020 (or at least I did do every week until I didn't) where I count out all the words I've written during the week.

## What is Missing Days?

**Missing Days** are days during the project that I didn't write on originally in 2020, but I will fill with some words. It might be something motivational, or something that I remember doing during this particular day that I put in late.
