They say God created the world in seven days. So I could say, that this is the end. I have failed, yet again. My lack of motivations has overcome my sense of dread. The need to finish things, to graduate. The future become more uncertain now, even when I was sure I know what to do. The darkness still envelops me even when the light was as bright as ever. Bring me the days to come, the dread still returns. The guilt is nothing but a wave of feeling that rise and ebb like water of the blue seas.

Good things comes to an end. This was not a good thing, but indeed it has come to an end. The slump continues and it looks like it'll never stop. The alternative is nothing. I haven't found any alternate solutions. I have tried things, but the result would not made me instantly motivated. Life goes on, and I'm just one of people who stll haven't known what they would do for the rest of their lives.

The flow of water seems to slow, yet I want this raft of life to arrive faster than ever. The creation of things in this world of creativity stand still and have not continued as if the juice that brought the gears of a working, thinking brain was empty like its heart.
