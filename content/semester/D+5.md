What to write? What to write? What to write? What to write? What to write? What to write?

Vigorous typing of repeated words, insanity is to believe it would change each time. Cold blast of air blew through my shirts, and everyone chilled to the bone as I am. Repeated cycle of on and off, air conditioners were a pain to control. Orange braids hung limp on my arms, hugging the thin and weary hands.

Passionate people passing personal perspective, 
opinions only often orally omitted. 
Written when, where, while we were waking. 
Alliterative alphabets algorithmically aligned as an article. 
Just joking, I intend indeed. 
Every ending, everything ever endlessly evolving. 
Losing love, letting loneliness, lucky lot. 
Begging, beeping, been busting by bastard's blimp. 
Absurdist breaking content, dying entertaining for God. 
How I justify killing, losing meaning nothing of personal questions. 
Rise, stand tall, uniting volition with your zest. 
Art means nothing when you break your own pace.
