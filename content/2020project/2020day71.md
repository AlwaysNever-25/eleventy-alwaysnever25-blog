We have another ejection today....

Because of an unexpected situation where I have to go anyway. Well, fuck'im. I already have the information, all I need is to turn in the goddamn paper. Too bad he got me out before that. Whatever.

I learned the history of the blackest material in the world. Anish Kapoor is the dick who owns the right to it for art, and a brave man called Stuart Semple did some protest of his own by creating multiple color of his own. The pinkest Pink, another color of black called the Better Black, and other things. I got to read this history because I read a meme post about editing this sculpture in America called the Bean, and Anish Kapoor is the one who created it.

People started referring Anish Kapoor as if he's infamous, and of course some people need an ELI5 of that, or a general explanation.

I read that.

I also learned how to configure with Arduino in Linux, with the surprise replacement class. It is a surprise for me because I didn't read the group chat in Whatsapp that announced it. With the events that happened yesterday, I really understand why I missed it.
