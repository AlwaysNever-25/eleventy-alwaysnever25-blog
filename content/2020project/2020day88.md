The future is bleak, bleaker than ever before. I thought I was going to fade as soon as I make changes in the past, but I woke up in the future, still ravaged by problems.

Nothing's changed, so I go back and return to the past. The virus spread faster than it supposed to be. It should be spreading at the holidays before the year 2021, and create a population bottleneck for the world, but it came faster.

That's why I wasn't writing, at least myself in this timeline. I was quarantined and miserable. I didn't eat in a day, my thoughts are scrambled, I got busy.

Excuses, excuses. But I understand. I'll fill this in so that they won't lose their streak. I know that this project is the only thing that can keep him sane in the coming days. It'll be a shame if it ends early.
