Last night, the actual translation, proper translation, to the Kaguya chapter cometh forward. The meltdown began again. I spend about three hours just memeing and fucking around there instead of sleeping, it kinda fucked my sleep schedule a bit. I don't care, the chapter is actually kinda divisive, and it's fun watching them meltdown and kinda fan the flames a bit, and also talks about it with them.

Today, another day that I should've gotten something to learn, but I got only the code for the online roll call(?). It has been two straight weeks that I don't have anything to learn, not that I'm complaining, but I can only imagine how I'm gonna do in midterms if the professor is not teaching me anything.

Also, today is the day I break. I finally made my character without waiting for the Aasimar in Arcacia. I'm back. I'll be a mountain dwarf barbarian this time around, called Bolgreth Boulderguard. I've already made two characters, ready to be plugged in to roll20, and some more.
