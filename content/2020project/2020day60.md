I can't write from laptop because I'm busy, and this is one of the things I expected when I started going to college. I was surprised that I was able to do the prep week last week, but the reality come up to me this week. I was so busy that I forget to put something in the project. I have a page full of writing in paper, that I haven't yet transcribed digitally, and I'm not sure when would I put it in the project.

I watched The Invisible Man, and it was scary. I hate horror, but the one I hate the most is horror like this. When the thing you should be scared of is unable to be seen. Paranormal Activity is one of the examples, and this one is a movie version of it.

Wait, this year is a leap year? FUCK. I made a mistake.

Wait, no. I'm not making a mistake. I'll relegate this extra day later in the year, when it's close to a new year. That's what I do. The month is ending, and I'm having a review for the month tomorrow. I'm excited.
