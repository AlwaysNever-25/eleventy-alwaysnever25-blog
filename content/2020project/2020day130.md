Laptop fan broke, can't open laptop for more than a few minutes, 15 minutes tops. I can only open for important things, like assignments and stuff. This is goodbye until I have an external fan, coming 2 days from now. Godspeed, I'm already miserable trying to replace the desire to open laptop by playing with my handphone. It's like the time I have to put my laptop into repair because my keyboard is kaput. I was miserable as fuck.
