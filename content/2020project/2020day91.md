Wow, what happened? Something's changed.

Oh well. You know what? Today's the last day of the first quarter of the year, the last day of the month, and coincidentally, the last day of the week. Tomorrow, we're going to have 3 review at the same time. It's going to be wild. 

The whole world has been wild so far, wait... I think I've talked about this before....

I've been busy with work and games and surviving life for the last 3 days. I think I remembered not writing at all these last 3 days? But wait, there are kilobytes in the files though....

Something's weird.

God, what the hell is this headache. What is that sound?

Clock ticking?
