5 days in a row, I have written. Scraps, a paragraph only sometimes. But it is an effort. An effort that I hope would not stop until it's finished. If Jacksfilms can do it for a year, with more gusto and goddamn late planning, I can do it as well. I have the will now, but do I have the endurance?

Can I make myself write each day for a year?

With enough resolve, yes I can. No buts.

And I do not want this to end in January again, please. Not again. Not, another, heartbreak.
