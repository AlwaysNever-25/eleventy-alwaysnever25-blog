-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 7

Got into a rabbit hole of the Economic Crisis of 2008, reading about C++ (Struct, class stack, operand), and some weird searches.

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
