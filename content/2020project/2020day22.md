As you can see, I forgot to write in Day 18. This is a mishap that will happen sooner or later, and this will happen again maybe when I entered college. I got so much in my plate that I might forget to do some writing in the week or something. As long as I still write 2020 words a week, I can still let it be. However I've made an empty file as a reminder of that day. Day 20 was when I realized that I didn't write during Day 18, and I overcompensated. I put edited stories as a replacement for prompt last week, and I consider it an acceptable replacement for the prompt rules. I've explored my oneshots that has no connections to Stickverse, especially Arcana. I know some of the paths for this story now, at least. I've considered writing more character, but I'm not sure. There's also a consideration to finish the backstory of The Creator and A, and the path is clear there. I've written what I want to write in the future as a foreshadowing. I know the way to that, but not how. I'm still stuck on A's character and his descent to madness.

My vacation has reached it's last breath. The end is coming in Day 26, morning. A day before that, I'll have something special. You know what it is.
