This file is written entirely from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Linux Gang woz heere.

It is Valentine's Day. Love is in the air, at least for me. Spent some quality time together with her, doing some things. Wasting some hours, but I'm happy. Later tonight, I'm going with her whims. I'm not sure I should correlate this, but I can't just outright reject her after that. It would be too cruel, and I'm actually quite fine with it. The stigma comes from my own mother's teachings anyway, and I think my dad's fine with this. He's the one that visits my mother's home a lot in his young days when they were in a relationship anyway.

Ubuntu is looking sleek, to be honest. I mean, I can't access majority of my stuff from here, but I can still access the Hard Drive, which contain this folder of .txt files. I can access spotify from here, nice. I am trying to get my Discord up and running here, and after that I can start adding some stuff. I'm not sure I should add too much though, because I only partitioned about 50 GB for the OS. I can still put most of my stuff to the Drive but the installments of programs would still need to be put on the partitioned Drive with the Linux OS.
