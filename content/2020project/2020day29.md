The spread of words here seems to repeat the Week 2 spread, and this means that we're still here writing YEAH! More update on my life; I took on a replacement slot for standard game, and my vanilla game is finally starting. I'm curious as to how I'm going to juggle playing 2 games like this. I've started the vanilla game hyper actively from the start, and I'm planning to play standard game like that. I don't know how they would react, because the list is filled with people that has never played with me before. Scum could easily push me for mislynch cause I am not good with pressure, but I hope I can provide some towny posts and useful reads. This standard game is beginning with a SK lynch d1 though, Jaiden Shenanigan as usual. It helps town however so I'm not complaining.
