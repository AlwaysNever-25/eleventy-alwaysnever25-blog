The 23rd day, I've not written a word until 23 minutes before day ends. I only realized the connection after writing that sentence.

I really don't know what to do with my life, what to write in today's file, and what to do with my ever decreasing whim to do this project. I can't keep doing this. I started it.

I started it and I have to continue. Until the end.

I've been hearing Eminem again after he's releasing another surprise album. Music To Be Murdered By. I liked Godzilla, and its intro. Darkness is another viral video waiting to happen. It is however, a great song that bamboozles you with it's lyrics. Unlike This Is America, you don't have to watch the video to enjoy it better. Also unlike Joyner's I'm Not Racist, this is better to be enjoyed separately. The mesh between the video and the song is great, but Darkness is a song that can stand on its own without the video. But enjoying the song through the music video is also great, so it's up to you. The emotional traction can be felt as you watch the video though, if you want to feel it from a song you have to be listening closely to the lyrics. If you can't, you should open Genius.com while listening to it.
