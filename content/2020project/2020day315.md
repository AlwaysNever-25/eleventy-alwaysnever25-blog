Last night on Critical Role, Mighty Nein trek through Eiselcross in chase of Molly, and slept in the cold. Also they found necrotic gems that won't be taken away from its place, and fought with a yeti group but it ends peacefully. In the end, they found where Molly are. More on that next week!

Also last night, on Heart of Tyre, back after an absence of a week because Summer was sick, they are fighting with the dashing Aleo, who started to activate his hidden phase. Things were done, but turns out the most effective one is the cocain arrows, because he was a former addict. He relapsed, and he said dumb things. Really dumb things. He got Violet Death kind of dumb things. They win the fight, but in turn they have to contend with their next fight being chosen by Aleo's husband, the powerful Minthis, and it is a violet servant. More on that next week!
