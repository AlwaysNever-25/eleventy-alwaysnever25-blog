I learn about the tool DnD beyond. I can't create the Trickery cleric there because it requires me to buy the Player's Handbook or the PHB, but I can create one on my own manually, by reading said handbook that is available online for free, albeit probably illegally.

Also, I watched WadZee, an australian Minecraft up-and-coming Youtuber, playing a Hardcore Minecraft. I am jelly.

I also watched some Handbooker Helper, by this delightful channel called Critical Role. I think this will lead me somewhere.......
