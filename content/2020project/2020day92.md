Because of the goal that I missed this week, and in celebration of the end of this quarter (first three months!), I'll make a special case and will waive around this mishap. I know that I'm pulling it out of my ass at this point but I don't care. This is my project. I decide what to do.

Looking at the word spread and total count (I decided not to create any goal for this month, for my sanity), it is a new low. Lower than January, but I understand. The college and quarantine didn't help with my productivity, and I was surprised that I still managed to reach 10k words this month. 

I'm only hoping that it doesn't go downhill from here.
