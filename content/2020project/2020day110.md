-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 6

It's all War of Omens today. The activity page is strangely light... I don't know if this means that I don't check Google that much, or I was just accessing things that Google did not detect...

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
