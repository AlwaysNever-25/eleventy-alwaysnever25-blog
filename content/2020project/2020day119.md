I have been neglecting this project for a while. I don't know why. I lost the passion that I had in the beginning of the year, compounded with the isolation and the lack of drive to do anything. This is a pit, filled with things you didn't want to but it spilled everywhere anyway. You try to fight it, but you can't fight a wave, a dark water that swept you away from perfection into the non-existence and procrastination.

Perhaps you should surrender.
