I almost didn't write anything today. There's nothing of importance that happened. I lost my quota after 16 days, that's a new record. I expected 50 GB to last me half a month anyway, with this Youtube filled consumption rate.

I was looking for some flashback in my harddisk, my Naga story. This could be my new prompt for the week, and another subgoal. But I'm not too sure about it. I only have clues in the badly taken screenshot of my ultimate book, that is blurry and even then, is very abstract. I really don't know why I have drawn all of that.

My writings getting a little bit low, but we still have 5 more days. We can pick up.
