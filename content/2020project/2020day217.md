The madlads actually did it, he signed up for another campaign!

After signing up, or replacing in, as the fighter Arne Nivarr, I signed up for another campaign of unknown story, this time intent on playing anything but human. 

I mulled it over and after a while, and some discussion with other players in the campaign, decided to be a Tortle Cleric of the Forge Domain, worshipping the deity Gond, the god of Forge.

He's lazy so he probably name this character Nivarr, and tie it somehow to a human NPC later so that it can become a great inspiration for a family name, but I digress.

It's crazy, now I have to juggle 3 campaign. My cynic self just know that one of these campaign will dissolve before the end of the month.
