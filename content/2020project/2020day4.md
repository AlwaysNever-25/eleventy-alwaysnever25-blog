Twitter for Android video by Jacksfilms came out, late. Should've been in the new years, but eh. I can manage. The video was like a culmination of a year-long project, something like this writing project. I wouldn't be able to dent his accomplishments though, that was hours and hours of editing. I'm only writing a few paragraph at a day, mostly. I'm still attempting for that two thousand twenty words a week tho. I'm going to see if I can reach it by the first week.

This is already going better than A Thousand Words though, to be honest. I just need to keep it up. I need to own my words.
