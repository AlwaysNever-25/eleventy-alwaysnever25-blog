Didn't sleep a wink last night. I just can't stop reading this new novel I bought last week. I finished it, and found out it's another kinda generic Wattpad stories. Cliched, but I can feel for them a bit. Doesn't wow me at all, or makes me cry. It scared me for a bit, but then it's all okay. The cover of the book is worth it though, it's just so clean.
