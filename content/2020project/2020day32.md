For now, I would say that I've done wonderfully. 11k words, that was more than what I thought I could write in a lifetime. I wrote that in a month. With this pace, I can actually write a novel length words in 5-6 months. Of course, the content of these project aren't actually coherent and connected like a novel, but I see this as an absolute win. 

A year ago, I wouldn't even think I'm going to write 11k words in a month, for anything. Now, I have. This project is going well. The big test, however, is coming in the next several months. I will be swamped by the many tasks in college, and this is the actual last hope I have.

I have to make this work or my dad would stop being patient with me. I think he has stopped being patient with me, but if I failed again this time I think he'll start being angry with me. I can't have that. I don't want to have that. I have to keep the status quo, for my own safety and for my mom's mental health. She needs to live in a positive environment, and my own failures could doom her.

I need to confess. I used a time changing date to write this, because I forgot to do it and I have passed midnight before I remembered it.
