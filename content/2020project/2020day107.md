-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 3

I continued to look at Far Cry and Unturned things, with an addition of War of Omens now. I also followed Tower of God anime at the time, and I feel like I could find what I said about that somewhere deep in my old laptop, but it's broken now... I have to bring it to a repair shop.

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
