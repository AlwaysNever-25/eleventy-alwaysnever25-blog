I was a backup to a oneshot campaign, but I missed the reply and the slot was transferred to another player. I'm fine with that, because I don't think I'm ready to play this close to another session as well. TMT will be at 11pm, about an hour from now. My tortle is rad, and I like him. I'll be the tank of this group and be their beefy dude in the front. I'm happy with my character and I can't wait playing with this people.
