I'm losing will, and actually started to forget, this project entirely. I am too tired, and too affected with sickness to spend my energy here. I'm going to be tired like this until probably this entire week. I hope that I could start regaining that momentum again, I know that I spent all of it during the prep week before. At least now I know that I have my limit, 60 days straight of writing finally takes it's toll on me, also with the added sickness and things to take care of.
