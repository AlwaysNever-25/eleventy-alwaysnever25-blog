I finally have a T5 Crusaders. It was the newly released Tiernan, which kinda sucks if I'm being honest. I hate that I missed the opportunity on getting Jiaolong or Wrena, but I can be patient and wait for them yearlong. Or I can get lucky and have them as a rare recruit mission. That's very unlikely though.

The last time I had these kind of mission was to get Bruno the Unicorn. I actually got him, and I think there's a cooldown to the occurence of this mission. I also remembered getting Arachnobuddy this way, also very early in the game I got Foresight this way. I don't remember the other Crusaders that I got this way though.

Day 3 on self-quarantine, I'm planning to get out for a bit. I'm starting to get sick of staying here, even though that's the best thing I can do right now. And this is literally the dream, you couldn't ask for a better one. But it turns out there's something in the room that my eyes can't seem to adapt to, and this has been going for months now. I think it's because of the dusts, but I can't be certain unless I clean them all up, and you know I'm too lazy for that.

I'm going for a photoshoot in the morning, and right now I should be sleeping.
