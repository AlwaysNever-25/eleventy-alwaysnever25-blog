-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 9

My speakers on my old laptop seems to be sputtering out on this day, because I was searching for that problem on Google.

If an even older version of Al can figure this out, please edit it here. I was searching for something called 'alightphoenix', or 'alightphoenix unturned'. The same search I did today didn't result in anything at all, so if you find out in the future... just add things here. 

You also searched for OYO 1598 Feby Inn, but I'll just assume you were reading Twitter about a viral news of someone fucking there or something. -Day 59 Al

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
