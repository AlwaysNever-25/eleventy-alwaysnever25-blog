-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 1

In this day during that Pandemic, I was focusing on Unturned. I had to search how to make Campfire for Unturned, so I'm assuming I was playing the heck out of that game.

I also somehow looked on PeterParkTV the streamer and this random girl called Vikki. Whuh....

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
