Grinding for Silver 4 or whatever.

I keep reminding myself that I have assignment but I keep forgetting and letting it flow. Fuck.

Tower of God has animes now, goddamn. It's been okay so far, but I really am curious how they would adapt the famous season 1 ending. And I don't wanna be too hopeful but I hope they can get another season after this. Viole would be a treat to have.
