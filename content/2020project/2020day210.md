Finished Dark finally. I stopped for a bit cause mind explode. Season 3 didn't help. I think my brain is about to burst.

I take my maid to the market again today, my position in the family has shifted now. I'm now the transporter. I'm glad that I can be useful, that's all. I feel bad about all the sneaky beaky shit I've done all these years, and so I'm glad I can return the favor by doing something.

I feel empty today, I don't know why.
