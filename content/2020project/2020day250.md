After a few days of working it out, I finally finished the Bard subclass concept that I had for the weekly event in Discord&Dragons. I also have been busy playing in this semi-daily Arcacia games and have retroactively put my RP conversation in the day that I wrote it. I still haven't written my bonkers session with Sailors of Tidewater and The Seas of Sudtry yet but it's coming. Sailors were mostly RP and only combat after I left (which is unfortunate), and Sudtry are actually mostly RP as we head to the shrine that Eizen are curious about.
