I think with this, the weekly review cycle should be fixed.

WEEKLY REVIEW : 2706 words of 2020 words
Day 78 : 229  words
Day 79 : 1037 words
Day 80 : 486  words
Day 81 : 342  words
Day 82 : 11   words
Day 83 : 386  words
Day 84 : 215  words


I found a new rabbit hole in the middle of this week. notpron.com is a website of puzzle made by Daniel Munich, of germany. He created this in 2004 and it boasts the completion rate of 67 people in the current time.

That's why I had 11 words written in Day 82. I think I spent most of the time writing in my notpron diaries instead. But I might be wrong. I am right now at level 15, and the progress is going slow but sure.
