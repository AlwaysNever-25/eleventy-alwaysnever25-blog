It's been one month since I write anything. I've been busy. 

College? Not only that. I've played Arcacia now, with a new character since Dodgren dies. Did he died the last time I write this? Maybe, maybe not. I don't remember.

Broken Bonds is finished at 12 episodes, with them fighting a violet servant somehow without a sweat, which was surprising. I started watching several of the other campaign as well, including the newer campaign The Tearing Veil also known as The Unwise Six, The Herald's Call a.k.a the Shroud group, and Weal and Woe a.k.a Jae's group.

I also started watching old select episodes, finding myself unable to watch it completely since it is hours and hours of time that I need to dedicate myself to.

I started doing some edits on the wiki of fan-run Verum wiki, which is woefully under-updated but I did some stuff on it, for others to build later maybe. There's a website coming when Arcadum reached 10k subs later, so this should be obsolete but this is fun work so I did it.

I don't wanna talk about college.
