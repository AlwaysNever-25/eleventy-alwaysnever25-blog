-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 2

I had a problem with Far Cry 3 during this day in the pandemic. I do remember having an account problem, which was mentioned earlier in the project. I also continued playing Unturned, now seeing if I can fix these vests that I scavenged and stats of Mega Zombie. I also looked for calculator for polynomial calculus, so I was also probably stuck in a college course at the time.

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
