I've been noodling with the idea of a barbarian, and after some deliberation I decided to go forward with it. This is a character I'll play if it takes too long for Aasimar to be unlocked. I'm still researching a bit over how I'll do this character (point buy, race, feat/ASI since I'm level 4).

After some conversation, and also deeper talk with myself about following the paths of Maglonta, I decided to become a Mountain Dwarf barbarian. I took the point buy and maxed it (15) on Strength and Constitution, and then took a bit lower on dex (14) and make the last few points on Wisdom (10). I let my Intelligence and Charisma modifier low (8) since I don't need em as barbarian. Character name will be revealed when I got the chance to use it hahahaha, or you know, just go to the Dnd/Arcacia/characters folder? You dumb or something?
