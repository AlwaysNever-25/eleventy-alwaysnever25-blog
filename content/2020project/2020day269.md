The Game of Gold, an idea

DnD 5e offshoot, with focus on doing checks and social interactions, combat exists but only when the circumstances ask for it (fighting in a fighting pit, for example. or in a duel.)

there is no XP in this game, you start at level 1. the progression will be milestone, but the milestone is not a point in a certain story. it is how much gold you carry with you. encumbrance rules are set aside, or can be kept but loosely followed. money is hard to exchange, since higher currency is much rarer and is a sign that you're wealthy.

you start with 10 copper piece for each character. any starting gold you get from your background or class is taken away from you. you cannot choose starting gold, nor can you sell your starting equipment until you're level 10.

10 electrum, 50 silver or 500 copper to get to level 2
15 electrum, 75 silver or 750 copper to get to level 3
20 electrum, 100 silver or 1000 copper to get to level 4
25 electrum, 125 silver or 1250 copper to get to level 5
25 gold, 50 electrum, or 250 silver to get to level 6
50 gold, 100 electrum, or 500 silver to get to level 7
10 platinum, 100 gold, or 200 electrum to get to level 8
20 platinum, 200 gold, or 400 electrum to get to level 9
50 platinum or 500 gold to get to level 10
60 platinum or 600 gold to get to level 11
70 platinum or 700 gold to get to level 12
80 platinum or 800 gold to get to level 13
90 platinum or 900 gold to get to level 14
100 platinum or 1000 gold to get to level 15

after this, your level now are fluctuating. it will never go below 15, but if you lose the money you earn to get level higher than 15, you will be demoted. expect to lose a lot during this stage.

250 platinum for level 16
1000 platinum for level 17
2500 platinum for level 18
5000 platinum for level 19
10000 platinum for level 20

each 10000 platinum you earn after level 20, will be put into a system called 'prestige'. once you earned the ninth prestige, you'll become the king of a country.
