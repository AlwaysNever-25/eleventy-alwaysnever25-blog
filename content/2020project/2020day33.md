The best ideas that I have come up with sometimes came in weird times. Delirium as I was starting to sleep, overcome with tiredness that I was almost losing consciousness, when I was in great distress. It always come in what I could describe as an inappropriate timing. Sometimes when I was aiming to write, I wouldn't get inspired at all. Sometimes when I want to call it quits and goes to sleep or play, it came like an unwanted feeling. 

A daily reminder to Ctrl+S everytime you wrote a large amount of word. You can fix it, but it would suck if you suddenly lose power or forgets to save and the deadline passed, right?
