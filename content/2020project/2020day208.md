Broh wtf happened, mxmtoon was interacting with GeorgeNotFound (dream's friend)? AND DREAM RESPONDED KINDA JEALOUSLY? WHAT IS THIS WATTPAD STORY WRITING ITSELF?

also found out that there's a lot of twitter user stanning George.... or even the dream team in a whole.... dttwt.... what the fuck is this?
I think I stumbled into something that I don't want to stumble in the first place......

We take to the roads today. Also, binged Dark season 2. Finished. Wanted more. Am finishing downloading the season 3 now. Season 2 is peak.

Why say lot words when few do trick? I'm tired. Dark makes mind broken. Charlotte is the daughter of her own daughter. How can that be.

Mikkel dies because Jonas tried to save him, giving him the idea of killing himself.

Claudia killed his father Egon because she tries to save him.

Mind broken. I can't

The seas call for Al in a few hours. I need to sleep. Tomorrow morning is hectic as all hell.
