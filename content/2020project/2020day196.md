I've been cycling for the last two days, the first one is to get my bicycle from the garage where we go to fix it back home, and the second day is an intended training of my leg by cycling for 2 laps around my neighborhood.

Today however, I'm not doing it. I'm saving my energy for tomorrow morning's game of DnD. I've prepped for it hard, but I know that I really don't know a thing about this yet. I only know my character and what he can do, I don't know a thing about the story. The mystery makes me excited and worried.

I can also finally get to drink that coffee that I waited for days to drink, so that I can have some boosts on energy while waiting for the session time.

I thought the coffee would work, but the inverse happened. It made me so tired that I wanna go sleep. But I persevered. I stay awake, and the caffein kicks in. I have the energy, and the game session is coming.
