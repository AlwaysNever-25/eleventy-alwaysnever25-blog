DaD has a major crossover going on, with almost 20 characters joining the call in this historic day on Verum. That is a lot of characters from a lot of campaign, including those that I thought would not be there like Heart of Tyre, but turns out being the color of Green, Falcon can do whatever the fuck he wants I guess, or Arcadum just bends the reality a bit to make this happens finally. The trigram isles is opened as three changelings focus on the bowl.

It is a beautiful session, with snakes, and the usual nipples and horny, like DaD. I tolerate it a bit since it wasn't as bad as usual, but I don't know if I have the tolerance to watch from the beginning, so I am only excited of DaD because of this major crossover the likes I was only promised but now actually happened.
