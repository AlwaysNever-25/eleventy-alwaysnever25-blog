(In this day on the original project, I didn't write anything. This will not be the only time this happens, but I'm putting here to remind myself, Day 17 of 2024 Project Al, to not do the same thing. You have four years of experience compared to this guy, you even write more compared to him when wordcounts are compared, I think.)
