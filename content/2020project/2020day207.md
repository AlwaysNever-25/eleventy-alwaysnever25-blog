I binged Dark Season 1. I got hooked. I can't stop. Time is relative, future defines the past, and vice versa

Time loop makes Daisy's world turn into a jumble of actions in time that can't be extended. Coulson has to watch everyone died. Enoch is bad, programmed to be by the mind-surpressed Jemma to protect her own memory implant. Enoch sacrificed himself after it was found that his heart is the answer. Cue sadness, cue Nathaniel being underdeveloped.

Started downloading Dark Season 2. Can't wait after that ending, shit's were made to be binged. Glad that I know this when it's ending. I can't live waiting for this. I have a lot to wait.

I exited the BnHA server, because I felt like I didn't fit there, and I don't have the burning fire to do it anymore. Someone can take my place and roleplay there.

Speaking of which, only 2 days until the seas call for Al.
