Episode 2 of Broken Bonds are freaking good. Bruh are they baiting fanfic writers with Daddylon and Bryan? My god, hearing that was hot.
Genesis shard and the vision is also intriguing. We're getting it boys. This makes me inspired to do DnD as well, so this better last a while.

Also, it turns out that they release podcast about an hour or more before the DnD livestream, so I can hear that next week if I wanted to before listening in the livestream. I'm excited to where they're going.

I also watched the most recent episode of Running Man, since I found out a funny clip from it. Turns out the whole episode is like the spiritual successor to the Genius show, with more fun and less serious mind games. It's still Running Man. They have their own flair, but the games are definitely inspired by the games of The Genius. Man I missed that show.

In other news, I'm going to have a sesh for BnHA in a few days, wish me luck.
