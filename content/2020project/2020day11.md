I have shutdown my computer way before midnight, but still I sleep at 3-4 A.M. I think this is heading towards insomnia at this point. I will try to sleep at 11 PM tonight, no buts. I need to get ahead of this and establish a healthy sleep schedule so that I won't be too overwhelmed when I go back to college.

I was busy all day, I've been to places that I really don't wanna be in, places that manage to confound me because of a misplaced google maps location, and some other miscellaneaous place. I don't think I had it in me to write some beautiful words today, just cold hard truth and facts instead.

I am tired, too tired to think. It's so heavy, my eyelids, my burden, my possible future. I need it do disappear for a second. That means mindless activities on the internet. Culturing our progress in games, watching Pewds doing absolutely new things on Minecraft.
