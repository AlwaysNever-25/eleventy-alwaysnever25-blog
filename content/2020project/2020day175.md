I am one step closer to getting that wayfarer, with the flashpoint of this week being Mercury. I finished the planet's heroic adventures, and now await for the flashpoint to change into Mars. After that, I don't know what to do. There are a lot of things to do before September, and there is a post about it in the subreddit. Keyword "what to do before September".
