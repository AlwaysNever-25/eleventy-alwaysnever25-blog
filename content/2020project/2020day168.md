Grind day 1:
Hunter done, Titan done. Warlock has received the Destination: Red War thingy. Also have the last hood for warlock. Niflheim Frost remain. Some new info, resonate stem can only be farmed on warlock, so I will farm on warlock tomorrow. I will raise my warlock to 1000 power level, and I have done the starter quest for this season. I'm still debating buying season pass.

TLDR; Tomorrow, warlock only. Strikes and shits are open. Still no crucible tho.
