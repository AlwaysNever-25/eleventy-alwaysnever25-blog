The session for this week for the Lost Mine of Phandelver has been cancelled, and I'm glad. That meant I can sleep to prepare for the Magical Table, and think over the character I wanted to play. I've said that I want to be a Tortle Cleric in the Forge Domain, and I'm still researching about Tortle to play it convincingly, at least to my own standard.

The seas also call for Al, but for now the seas will make Al traverse the island. I'm excited where it will take me, and where the characters will go, both plot and character wise.

I also makes the choice to binge the last 8 years of Questionable Content. I am not regretting this at all. I think I won't sleep until late tonight. The backlog will take a lot of hours to finish, until current comic.
