I have to go out today, and I know that. I already awake at the appropriate time and I'm ready to take my maid to get the stuff my mom needs for her cooking time. But then after all was done, and I already showered and stuff, turns out I have to return to the market to grab one last thing the shop owner forgot to put inside one of our bags. 

I have to go out again, and then I have to shower again. It sucks. I want to be mad, but it's really unfair for everyone involved. So I bottled it in, because even I know that my rage are childish in nature at best.

I think I need to work my way on bottling it in a little bit better though, because some people can still realize when I was hiding my anger.

OTOH, more drama ensues. Moe came out with his version of the story, and filling up the mystery of doc being banned arc, there's a drama arc between xQc and the Ninja family (Ninja himself, Ninja's Wife/Manager Jessica Blevins and Ninja's brother), with some other people being dragged into it like Alinity for example.

I am now a drama junkie. Fuck this quarantine. Kidding, I don't need quarantine to get into this shit. Fuck my life.
