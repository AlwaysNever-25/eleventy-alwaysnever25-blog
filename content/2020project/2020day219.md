I learned today about Halifax explosion, after reading about Beirut explosion that happens two days ago. It was the biggest explosion that is not a nuke, and looking at the picture, it's really scary.

I also reread Naruto again, but this time comprehensively and compares my own thought with the r/Naruto's discussion of the chapter, it was fascinating looking at a discussion over 7 years ago. The MANGA HAS ENDED FOR OVER 7 YEARS. WOW. I'M OLD.

I was surprised that people commented a lot about Talk no Jutsu, that was funny. I also notices a lot of things that I didn't before, because I read carefully this time. It's not earth-shattering but just little details that makes this reading more special. The only thing I managed to find different is that there's like a last page missing from the last volume of Naruto that I own, volume 72, that I finally able to read after 7 years.

Also read up on some synopses of Naruto LN, Kakashi Hiden and Shikamaru Hiden especially. Those are kinda good, the synopses. I don't think I'm going to read it, but the little story is great for my own enjoyment and knowledge of this great story that already ended.
