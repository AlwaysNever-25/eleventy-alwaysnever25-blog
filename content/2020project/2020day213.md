The fighter called Arne Nivarr entered the city, looking for the dwarf that has the secrets to the mine that can bring him wealth, and possibly helps him in civilizing the city that rightfully belongs to him.

He found a company of fantastical adventurers also in the search of the dwarf, and joins them in their pursuit of the dwarf that was taken by the goblin to a castle in the vicinity.

The satyr, the tortle, the warforged, the elf, what a combination. He learns of the existence of Red Brand and seething with rage to attack them, but he can't do this alone. He needs help, and for now it seems like they aren't ready to help him yet, to dispose this city of this bandit like mercenary.

He is only human, but he'll made a difference.

They traveled towards the castle for Gundren the dwarf, sharing stories about their first fight. Arne remembers fighting someone when they insulted his swordplay technique. It was another noble, a stuck up kid that thinks he's better than anyone, but he didn't tell them that. 

They reached the "castle" where Gundren is being held captive, and after scouting, hatches a plan.
