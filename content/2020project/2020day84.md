A dude on top of a AskReddit post pointed me towards a puzzle website called 'Notpron'. The question was 'What interesting rabbit hole can you suggest when we're self quarantine' or something like that.

I decided to tackle it, but I lost my attention and ended up reading a lot of other rabbit holes first ("Death Valley Germans", Delphi murders, re-reading Cicada 3301) but I managed to get back on track.

These were boasted to be the hardest puzzle you can ever possibly imagine. There are 140 levels in the entirety of the puzzle, and only 67 person has ever completed it since its inception back in 2004. 67 out of millions who have tried it.

I looked at the comments for this, to look at other's perspective, and one said that the last level was said to contain what was called a 'Remote Viewing'. You should google that, it was a mixed bag of interesting, crazy, intriguing, and mind-boggling at the same time.

Because of how this puzzle encourage people to keep track of the previous puzzle's answers, I'm going to make a separate file on the puzzle answers that I have solved for reference. I do solve one or some of this by accidentally looking at a complete guide, but it was accidental.
