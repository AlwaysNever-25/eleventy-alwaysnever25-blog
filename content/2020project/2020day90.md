The first quarter is heading towards an end. Quarantine is messing with my whole schedule. I know that I was miserable, I have to create my own food and I was generally lazier because I didn't eat.

I foresee that I'll miss on some more days at the start of next quarter. I forgive myself though, these are trying times. I know that I'll survive but I won't be writing while I do.
