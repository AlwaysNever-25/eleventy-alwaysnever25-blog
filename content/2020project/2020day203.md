Dream released a FINAL REMATCH of Manhunt 3-man version. It was filled with clutch moments, especially the horse, the strider, and the old trick called Ender Pearl. Shit's fun, especially after the new update, but it wasn't as thrilling as before. It still have clutch, I just didn't feel the thrill, I don't know why. There are many mistakes in this iteration of the match, and I felt like even if it's humanizing, it also kinda detract in a way? I don't know.

In another story, I finally reached out and stop holding myself back. I apologized because I was sick (true, but not until now) and my mom's sick (true, even now), and we hope it's not the virus. I really hope not. I don't want my mom to die because of me.

Also, I've been wanting to save that Broken Bonds animated version by this redditor. He took the audio and makes something good out of it. I feel like saving it.

I also found this youtuber couple, a swedish girl and a korean boy. I don't know why this was recommended, but I watched it still. I cringe a bit.
