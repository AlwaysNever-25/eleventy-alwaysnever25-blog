I decided to join a one-shot of DnD 5e today. That was an impulsive decision, but the recruitment really ask for beginners only, and I am intrigued. The time is fine for me, and I decided to ask to join. I joined, and I have discussion about the character I wanted to play, which is a human Cleric of Trickery Domain, that was tricked by a god become his servant after he prayed for his Noble family that are almost destitute to regain their wealth and title. He was then brought by the follower of the god Mask into becoming an adventurer. 

The one-shot itself will be about a strange happenings at a small city, other than that I don't know. After confirming that I'll be in the session, I started reading up on the cleric and their spells, which will come in handy soon. I read up and learn a lot about cleric, about cantrips and their spells. About their possible background and equipments.

So that's what I do. I hope this will be a nice entry way to play DnD, I'm excited to play this but never has the guts to do it, nor time. Now I have time, and I have the opportunity. I will not squander it.
