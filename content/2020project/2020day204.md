I refound Idle Evolution again, after finding out that Newsground is actually now unblocked, because before I always got that telkomsel block when opening the site. I replay the game for a bit, and then leave it behind. It's an idle game.

I found out that the "my name jeff" from Wadzee videos (great Australian up-and-coming Minecraft Youtuber, watch him) are actually from 22 Jump Street. Fitting, because I never really watch the entirety of the film, I missed some parts of it. I know the majority of the plot, watched parts of it. Never the full movie though.

I found this series called Dark, which deals with time shenanigans, that's I N T E R E S T I N G.

SOMI'S SONG IS BANGING. Definitely not for everyone though, because it might be bland to some people, but this is somehow better than Birthday. I don't know why....
