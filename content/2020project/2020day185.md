I have advanced my notpr0n adventures to level 59, stuck at a poem intermingled with pictures. This form of poem is called a rebus, fun fact. I asked around because I was stuck, and getting more frustrated after I can't get my head around the answer.

I understand now why this took people a while, I don't even think I can finish the positives during this year now, even with all this free time.

I also found this Tsubame colored pages from the chapter where Ishigami accidentally confess that I really like. I really like it, because I had a thing for girls with a colored hair. Seeing Tsubame with such colors.....
