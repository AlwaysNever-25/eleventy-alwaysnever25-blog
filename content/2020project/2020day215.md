I went of the rabbit hole called Critical Role, and also some more things D&D. 

The seas call again in just under a day.

There's also finally, a release of Kaguya. The chapter came much more slowly than anticipated, because the translator, the old one, were retired. There's a new one that is still in process of replacing the job of the old one, and it seems like the changing kinda impacted the release being much more slower than before. Heck, there's already a spoiler for the next chapter by the time this release came out, so it was really, really late. I can't really complain though, it's free and I didn't really pay for it. It is what it is.

I also reluctantly registered for something I didn't want.

I also watched a lot of What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, now that I found a reliable website to download it from. The video in my harddisk are strangely corrupt and can't be accessed or deleted. Whuh.

The drama's been funny, of course with more korean drama tropes in between. Nothing's special, just an intriguing past of the male lead and then nothing. Kinda funny though, it makes up for the nothingness.
