-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 4

I am beginning to think that I am addicted to Unturned at this point, cause I'm still on it. (Looking for Washington's full map image with loots, Hawaii loots, and PEI map). I also found out about 2b2t (might've found out about it earlier), and read about Rajj Show (basically Twitch's the Bachelor and trashier), and trying to find out if they have the Rhythm of War cover out already.

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
