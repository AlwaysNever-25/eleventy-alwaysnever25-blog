Oh damn, I almost forgot to write today. This is getting depressing. I've written less in these 3 days than the entire 3 days of the first week. I think I'm getting weak-willed. I need to write more but I just can't find the motivation to do so.

I anticipate returning back to Surabaya, and how will this project continues when I'm there. 

My forum mafia games is going great, lynched scum yesterday. But I'm still unsure what to do forward. I know I'll scumread Acidic based on their "opportunistic" inactivity and sheeping, Jackson for their general attitude, and nobody else at the moment. They are all null, or very very weak scum/town. 

I have farmed idols with event freeplay, which was what I should've done since the first time I play. It gave back almost 4 times the amount of base idols. I've gotten all the crusaders I can (tier 3 max), I've hit my wall in 5000 levels on a crusader. With that wall I hit max level 773, and I have since using my idols to level up the cap for it.
