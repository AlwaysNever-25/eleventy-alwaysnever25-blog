135 knows how it ends.

It doesn't make him ready. He's already approaching twilight era, most people would say he's past it already and approaching death by old age.

But he has to do one more thing before he's expired, and incidentally this thing is the one that will bring the end to him anyway.

A closed loop, like that movie he watched during his teenage years.

Looper was one of the greatest thing I ever watched.

The story about time loops and their effect, the love that turns you upside down, the sacrifice to bring the greater future.

It brings him to tears, the story. He was still at his 20s but he can connect with the older character and his struggle to revenge when his significant other is dead. I also felt that he's cool, a gangster in Asia.

I have some cool ideas for this but I lack the drive needed to continue this. The prompt;

[WP] It's veritably the greatest heist of all time. The crew: You, at ages 16, 24, 33, 68 and all orchestrated by you at 135.
