I started the week and ended the week in high note, the curve for this week's data will look like a valley. I'm entering the fifth day of the self-quarantine, with pink eye symptoms already attacking my eyes like crazy. The status of this pandemic worries me, because it looks like the quarantine might extend to more than 2 weeks now.

Good news, I don't have to worry too much about college. I can stay at home for as long as I want.

Bad news, I have to buy my food, or make my own. I hate cooking my own rice. I can't see her for two weeks, compounded with the last time we have our quality time. It sucks, and the real fasting month is coming, which means I won't have the chance when that came. I think my electricity's not ready to handle me that is stuck in the room for the whole day. I will spend a lot of money just to keep it running.

A lot of bad news, but I think I'm just gonna focus on the positive now. I can play whatever the fuck I want.

I made a mistake. The review week was shifted. It should've been done in the Day 78 instead of Day 80. I made a mistake.

I propose a change. Shift the day 78 (the supposed day of the Weekly Review should be posted) and day 79 (the second day of the supposed next week) to the next week instead, substracting their words from the week. I know it would make the week a 5-day week instead, but I have counted and found out that I managed to get my goal even after I substracted it. So, the new Weekly Review;

WEEKLY REVIEW : 2199 words of 2020 words

Day 73 : 1061 words

Day 74 : 536  words

Day 75 : 70   words

Day 76 : 186  words

Day 77 : 346  words

*Week was cut short because I was delirious and forget that last week I put 8 days in a weekly review instead of 7, and there was a delay to the previous previous weekly review that added to the confusion.

With that being said, this is already the third day of the week. Talk about substracting days, really reminded me of how the British cut 10 days out of their calendar because they were changing their calendar. This is not exactly the same, but I'm just reminded.

I also have been watching Vsauce videos lately, and I even read a whole article in Wikipedia, about how scholars all over the world finally manage to translate Hieroglyphs, Hieratic and Demotic script of Ancient Egypt. It was a fascinating tale, that spans through centuries.
