I'm just made aware of Mipha and her story with Link in Breath of the Wild, and I'm sad now. I'm just sad. It's the epitome of tragic love story. I'm sorry I'm going to go cry now.

Agents of SHIELD is going nuts, chronicom's base is found and destroyed by LMD Coulson, however the chronicom managed to kill mack's parents and try to infiltrate using their skin, which is really freaking creepy. AND THE STINGER WAS THAT MACK AND DEKE GOT STUCK IN THE 1980s?!! THE LAST SEASON IS RAMPING UP DAYUMMMMMMMMMM

JIMIN LEFT AOA? Yeah, after Mina bully outrage, it is already confirmed at this point. She either will be kicked out, or will kick herself out voluntarily.

It is fucked though, what happened. Mina has to live through all that bullshit? Now I don't know if I can watch any show with AOA in it, knowing that this happen in the background. I hope she'll be okay, in this case I meant Mina. Jimin can maybe survive this, she's rich. But fuck her.
