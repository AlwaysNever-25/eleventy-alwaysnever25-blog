We are approaching the 200th day in the year now, and I still have gaps in my writings. Especially that missing month. I'll try to work on it, but I don't have it in me yet to re-edit all that, by determining what I do that day using google's activities history. I know that I spent my time more on Steam playing games instead of opening Google Chrome or other google-related things that might be recorded on the activities history, so the recollection wouldn't be as complete as I thought it would be. But that is the price, it wouldn't be perfect and I have to just accept that.

In other news today, I did some more errands that my father asked me to, and I am planning to farm more on Destiny 2. It hooks you back in, and I feel like I never left. Is this how people in toxic relationship feels like?
