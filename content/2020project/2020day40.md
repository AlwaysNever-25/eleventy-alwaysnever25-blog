....misusing their influence..


I spent the day yesterday and the day before that on an outing with my marching band. Not a camp, a moment of regeneration you could say. 


I was so tired afterwards, that I slept instantly. Only managing to write that Kendrick's lyrics on before sleeping. I also spent the day today sitting, resting, NOT EATING BECAUSE I'M SO LAZY. COME ON ME!
