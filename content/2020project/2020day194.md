I'm excited for Tuesday, I woke up very early today. I will have to wake up early for Tuesday as well, or I might just not sleep at all. I don't know. I've done some research, but I know that I can read more. I'm not done reading Player's Handbook the Fifth Edition, and if I'm going to jump into DnD full time during this holiday, I need to finish this.

I've done the sheet though, both character and the spellcasting, and the background is polished as it can be for now. I can add more, but I wouldn't put it in the .pdf file for now. Also, there's a chance that I'm going to change my spell, the cantrips and the first level spells.

The creation of this Cleric character helped me to go through this week, when there's no release of One Piece nor Kaguya, but there's an episode of S.H.I.E.L.D that I haven't downloaded yet because I want to perserve my quota for the month.
