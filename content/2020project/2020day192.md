I found out that Critical Role is a show about some nerdy voice actors playing DnD, and I happen to see videos about a character called Jester......

I'm dropping into another rabbit hole, aren't I? The consequences of deciding to play DnD, I can only assume.

Remember that Youtuber Wadzee, that I mentioned previously? I am now watching the complete series of him playing Minecraft but it's skyblock, BUT also it's only one block. It is interesting, and now I'm probably watching other videos by him.
