Life sucks now. I have not written anything for almost a week. The project is almost on its end. I already committed not to write if I can't reach 2020 words a week. Fuck that limitations. I'm doing shit on my own. Expect a lot of time travelers editing those empty days. I'm not doing the review anymore, this is a new quarter. New quarters, new rules, new spirit. I'm going to write freely now. The only weekly review I'm doing is the Monthly Review and if I'm doing another Nano Prep Week.
