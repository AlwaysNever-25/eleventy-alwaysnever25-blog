I've been made aware of the existence of something called the Asian Highway. It is a highway system that covers over multiple countries. It really looks cool and I wonder if there's someone who has traveled through the entirety of one of these. In case you're wondering why I say 'one of these', yeah, it's a system with multiple highway already existing in it. Including in my country, where the AH2 started.

I'm also jumping the gun and doing more DnD homebrew shit by joining another server. I'm probably going to be swamped, but after finishing the one-shot, I'm only going to be busy with this BnHA server, so I'm good with that. I really like the quirk concept anyway, so that's why I want to join this "server-wide lore campaign" or stuff.

The thing is, I'm still hiding something. And the more I do it, the bigger the fireworks will be when I decided to confront it. I'm going to, but not now. I'm not ready. I'm never going to be ready, am I?
