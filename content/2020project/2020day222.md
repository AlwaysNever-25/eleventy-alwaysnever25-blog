I went on another cycle today, after I think a week or more of not doing it. My dad wanted to do it, but he stopped after one usual lap around the usual trail. I took the bicycle and spent some time cycling through some place, feeling a little bit better when riding it compared to before. I was more chill this time, just enjoying the ride and the winds that swept over my body and face. It was great.

It might also be because this time I opened my mask partly so that I could breathe through my nose, before I didn't open it at all and I can't breathe at all. It definitely helps.

I also wanted to pass out now, and my legs are still turning into jelly after doing this. I guess I should try this more so that it won't feel like jelly afterwards.
