-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 8

I now understand what it means when I searched for Scorpion earlier before. I was talking about Scorpion, the TV series. Today I searched for Sylvester Dodd's gaming alias, El Guapo. This must be the time I got into Scorpion.

Honestly, it was a pretty fun show, albeit a suspend your disbelief kind of show though. I don't have a problem with that personally, but that means I have to be very careful recommending it to anyone.

Other than that, I also searched Destiny 2's Randal the Vandal for some reason, Crusaders of the Lost Idols, and some miscellaneous stuff.

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
