The coffee made me do this. I made my character's appearance, with GIMP and creative use of pictures from the web.

Because this is only for personal use and not commercial use, I'm sure that this is okay. Al the Cleric is basically Ishigami /ourguy/ with the mask that is the holy symbol of our god and savior, Mask the god of thieves.

Yeah, our god and savior. Indeed.

The result isn't too shabby, at least that's what I thought. The mask aren't great, I was expecting Joker's (from Persona 5) mask as the holy symbol but it was this shabby looking mask, that makes my character looks scary. I guess that was the intention? 

She thought it looked nice though, for a guy who never touch GIMP before. I was kinda proud of myself, nice going me.
