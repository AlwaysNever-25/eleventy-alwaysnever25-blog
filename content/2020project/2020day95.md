-Missing Days-
Day 3

JINBE IS BACK BABY, AND HE'S OFFICIALLY JOINING STRAW HAT CREW AS THEIR HELMSMEN. OH GOD I'M EXCITED FOR WANO ARC. HIS INTRODUCTION IN THE LATEST CHAPTER IS ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT AND HYPED ME UP MORE AND MORE.

Also I've been tussling with the drivers again, since latest update kinda broke the thing. I don't think I even fix it in the first place, to be honest. But yeah.

Tussling with Linux will result in some problems, and of course that is to be expected. I fiddled around with it for some hours, and finally managed to fix it. I even updated the drivers in my Windows too because why not?

However, microphone is now broken in Linux at least. I can't record any sound, and it makes one hell of a problem when you're having an online classes and you need to use Linux but you also need to talk at the same time. Example like the day before yesterday.

I can't fix the microphone somehow, so I'm going to wait until Canonical fixed it themselves.

Also I used CloudFlare's DNS to make my internet go faster, all thanks to LTT, and it does noticably goes faster now. Nice.
