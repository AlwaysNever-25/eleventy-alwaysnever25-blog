-Missing Days: Two Weeks-

Day 5

Searched for How I Met Your Mother (did it the previous few days too, but in limited form), Crusaders of the Lost Idols, differences between Debian and Ubuntu (I might have been booting from Linux while I do all this, which means my history is locked in that part of my old laptop).

And again, fucking Unturned. I am addicted to it. I was searching about how to fix vehicles... and finding out about Racecar, a type of vehicle.

(These are taken from my Google Activity page, showing me what I searched during that day back in 2020. In the original project, this text file was left empty, as I was not in the state to write my thoughts out.)
