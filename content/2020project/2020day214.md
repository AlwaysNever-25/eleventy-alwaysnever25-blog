For the past few days, I've been binging some Critical Role's campaign 2. Today, I was watching them delving deep into the gnoll mine when they encountered a charismatic blind person with white afro called Shakaste (with an a umlaut).

It's really good, their roleplay and prowess in combat (unlike me who sucks at both), and watching them fawn over Shakaste was a treat. Jester has that accent that makes me question myself. Laura's older than me by a decade, and the fact that she can do this voice just makes me really, really confused. I'm only attracted to Jester though, so no worries. I can separate the actress from the character. Jester's just that irresistible, probably because of her birth.

They also fought a manticore, and I have to witness Nott killing a baby manticore in order to save Fjord who were being held by a Hold Person spell. That was sick, in both connotation. It does help by making the manticore solely attentive towards Nott only though, but it makes Nott, the squishy rogue, a target.

They survived the fight, with Shakaste ending the fight spectacularly with his special Spiritual Weapon in the form of a bust of an actress, hitting the manticore straight in the heart, killing her.

LOOT.

And then Shakaste, the ever charismatic, goes away with a hush.
