My resolve is dying. I am now looking at D&D books and videos. My quota is almost out, and I'm buying some more tomorrow maybe.

But last week I managed to consistently write. If I keep up on doing this I could write a story. But, I need to keep doing this. It's 15 days in a row now. I can do this, I feel tired but I need to do this. I can't stop, otherwise what can I do in life. 

Also, it's the four month anniversary. Love her so much. This would be cringe when I broke up with her, but I hope it doesn't happen. I don't want to think much about it.

Applying the rules of A Thousand Words, I can put things I wrote in other files as long as it is written today. New rules each week bro! THIRD WEEK HELL YEAH.

Chuu's Teaser and Yves' Teaser came out today, they slayed. Heart Attack appearance FTW
