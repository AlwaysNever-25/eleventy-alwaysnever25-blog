-Missing Days-
Day 2

Train To Busan 2 teaser is here. Looks like it's action packed now, I really hope it has a really compelling story like the previous one or I'm going to be disappointed.

I'm going to try getting Adina the Wonderful as soon as possible, before the event ending in a couple of days.

Watching twitch stream will suck when I return to my hometown, cause I won't have the free reign on the quota and has to be limited to a certain gigabytes, so I have been letting myself go watch a lot of it these days.

Dreamcatcher also released a video, a special clip on one of their new songs in their new album. Like, all of them are kind of good. Sahara, Red Sun (the new video is this, with accompanied coreography), and of course Scream.

No offense to LOONA, god their new songs is also good, but in terms of quantity at the very least, Dreamcatcher has more good songs.

I have been debating on who I'm getting to be my junior/future successor on this secretary job, but I made my choice. Thankfully there's no pushback on my decision so I'm free to choose.

Also have been playing some Kongregate flash games, cause why not.
