There are a lot of assignment still, even when the courses is online. I have to go do it but it was hard when you don't have help. I was actually miserable because of it.

It's hard to try when you don't have the strength, you know. And to build up strength I have to rest or do more. But I know if I keep resting I won't be actually gathering strength, I'm just delaying the inevitable. I have to eat.

But my body is complaining, my mind is locked in this mindset of "I don't care". It's the pit but not the pit.

Help.
