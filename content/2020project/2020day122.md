I'm inspired to write something directed towards myself in 25. Dodie put out a video of a reply to her own video made when she was 20, a standard "asking a future me" video. Surprisingly, it is kind of sad. How would you feel looking at a person who hasn't gone through the experience that you had, and you found yourself looking to specific memories in the 5 years that has happened between the video and the current you. You find yourself surprised, that you managed to get through life, or that certain events has transpired. Or that you were able to write three months straight but you stopped writing somehow. Or maybe you're going to look at the quarantine as a heaven because life will be apocalyptic.

Ah, I'll probably make this one later.

The month of April has closed, and I hope with this I can restart the streak. It sucks when that happens, a streak being broken, but life happens. You must fall before you can rise and become better.
