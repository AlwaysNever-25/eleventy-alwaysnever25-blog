Ryhthm of War preview has begun. Prologue and Chapter 1 is released, but I know the majority of its content already. There are earlier previews that I have read. 

The prologue is of Navani's perspective of Gavilar's death, which her reaction was pity and no sadness at all. We got more crumbs, possibly the last crumbs we get before Gavilar's own perspective of his death is revealed in the next book. 

Chapter 1 is in the perspective of Kal's father, Lirin. Tending to wounds in the occupied Alethkar city of Hearthstone, Kal's hometown. He was to make contact with the leader of the resistance, the herdazian general they say called the Mink. This was the same general as in one of the interludes of the previous book, the one who set another person to choose between death or outrunning The Hog.

It was fun, first few chapters. The next one will came even sooner, and will be scheduled for weekly releases at that day. Tuesday, 9 AM EDT. About 20:00 WIB. Great time indeed.

The seas call. 3 days till Al answers.
