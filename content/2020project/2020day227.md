I lead a forum today, after avoiding a lot of people for a few weeks. I think I've done quite a nice job, and it was done in a timely manner as well. I quite like the crowd, they don't ask a lot of questions that are agressive and roundabout in nature, and they seemed to at least understand what it is. I hope?

They hope to have me again to lead next week. I don't think I can do it as graceful as this was, but if there's nobody that's going to do it....... I still don't want to.

It's really tiring. I hate it.
