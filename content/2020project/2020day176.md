I played Minecraft again, after debating to play for a long while. The reason I did it today out of all days is because of the newest update to the game called The Nether Update. It is an update that overhauls the Nether and add biomes, creatures, and much more stuff to it. I am excited to try to explore that, and yet the first world I created was kind of a bust. My spawn point is literally in the middle of a really big desert. I have to walk about 500 block-ish to get to a nearest tree. I almost died without having any tools, damn the game is harsh now.

Also, the finale of ToG is coming. After that push scene being adapted, I'm eager to see the Rachel perspective of it all. I know that when I saw it in the webtoon, I was very shocked and very compelled to do the impossible and read the entire webtoon. I hope it has the same effect towards everyone who watches only the anime.
