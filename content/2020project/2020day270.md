v1

**Temporal Aura**
*2nd level Chronurgy Wizard feature (enhance Temporal Awareness)*
Instead of adding your Intelligence modifiers to your initiative rolls, you can instead as a bonus action, share your temporal awareness to any creatures up to the number of your intelligence modifiers. Creatures with the awareness will roll their next initiative roll with advantage. This effect will last for 10 minutes, or until they roll their initiative.
