I decided to not get Day 66 a proper file. If there is, it's going to be empty like Day 18. I don't deserve to post one there, because that day was when I truly forget the project and I want a reminder of it. There will be times when I forget, and that has happened twice now. If the project were perfect, it wouldn't be a learning experience.
