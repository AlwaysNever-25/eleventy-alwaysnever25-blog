I am sick.

A lot of things get cancelled. Corona is spreading.

She's going away as well.

I'm hungry.

I can't write so much today. I'm too weak.

Most of my lectures are being transferred into an online system. Tomorrow I'll have the first of my online lecture. That means I have to wake up by 8, because I think the way they take attendance is going to be strict.
