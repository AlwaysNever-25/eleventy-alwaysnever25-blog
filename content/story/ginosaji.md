The stall was as generic as it comes, and you can see that it sold mostly weapons and shield, along with miscellaneous items.

There are many strange things in this stall, an old ragged mask, a shield made of a unknown bone, an ornate spear that looks brittle, and others. But one thing make you more curious above all. 

A spoon, a regular silver spoon, is in the middle of these strange collection of miscellaneous items.

"Uh, sir, is this yours?" You pointed the spoon out towards the seller, who only shows his back as he seems to be intent in doing something. You aren't sure if this spoon was mistakenly put in the middle of the stall or something.

The seller then turn around and looked at you. You see a man draped in black hood, his face is pale, black substance is around his eyes and his lips, this combination brings out fear and weirdness in you.

In a silent acknowledgment, he nodded to you and seems to be looking at you intently. He looked like he's expecting you to ask more.

"Is this for sale?" You continued, and then he nodded some more.

"But why?" You asked. He did not answer that question with a gesture, instead, he shuffled for stuff under his stall and came out with a paper and an ink with quill, and wrote something.

After a while, he gave you what he wrote, it says:
It will give you the strength to withstand anything, shrug off all magical attacks, with a cost of course.

You look at it and you can't believe what it says. No way a spoon can make you withstand attacks with magical means... right?

You then look at the seller, and you see that he's grinning now.

"At what cost?" You said. He took the paper, wrote something in it, then he gives you the paper back and offer you the spoon.

The paper said
Try it yourself.

You remember nothing afterwards.
