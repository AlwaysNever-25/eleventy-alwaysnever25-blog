I'm not gonna stop until I stop, and until hope is lost.

Hope is an addiction, it gives people nothing. It placates them to keep on hoping instead of working towards making the world a better place. They'd rather believe in hope instead of themselves. They let themself hope and keep hoping, and they never truly work. They just hope it will get better. 

I was them once. The world was hopeless, and I drive myself to work harder to create a better world. Hope wouldn't get my children food to eat, or bed to sleep, or home for their shelter when the rain comes. Hope wouldn't pay the bills, wouldn't make my wife happy.

And so I worked. Through the world that is thoroughly broken and morally corrupt. I did everything I can to make my family including myself survive.

But then someone came. A hope for the entire family, someone that can pay the entire family without the hard work that I believe to be needed. The only price was that he won't pay me a cent. They want my family, my wife, my children, but not me. 

The boss of a company. He found my wife while she was buying groceries. I can't blame her, in the process of working my jobs I became distant and focused in only the job. I can't blame myself, because I only did what I thought was the only way to support my family. I can't blame him, because he gave my family all those things they needed to survive in this world.

He gave them hope, so I'm blaming hope. 

People who hoped are people who never work for something. They rely only on hope and nothing else. So I destroy them.

I work at a weapons factory, and I also worked on the sideline as a supplier for illegal weapons trader. I know things, and so I used those knowledge to spur people to rise and live above hope.

I began with bombing their house, my own family who left me, who was lost in hoping and now lived a life in excess. I've seen them change before my own eyes, they all used to worked toward their goal. We used to work hard towards a goal. We saved money to go on vacations, to buy new things, but now look at them. They have a personal driver, an army of butlers and maids.

It fattens them, quite literally. They're all became a comfortably lazy sloth. They don't work towards it, they just married themselves into a rich family.

They lack motivation, and they think they don't need one because now they can live and die comfortable. They were wrong.

And quickly afterwards I became lost in insanity. I began to see people who hoped everywhere. Anyone who even began to say hope were on my sight, my target.

Hope killed my happiness. It takes them away. And so I take the happiness of people who hopes. It was the only logical thing I can think of.

I did my thing for a while. Then someone became a beacon of hope for everyone.

The man with the wings. The Angel, they said.

He penetrates the people with rays of hope again, when I have worked my ass off to deter them from hoping. To work hard instead of hoping, and now they all will hope again.

I see red. I will take those wings and give them proof that hope was not an answer.

And it will never be.
