Do you want a new life? A new identity, shedding away your old one cause it's too "hot" and you needed an out? Or you were targeted by one of your "employers" after you ratted them out, and you know for a fact that they have mole even in the side of the law, and you wanted to be gone untraced?

I can help you with that.

I'm the guy you call when you want to disappear. Some call me the Disappearer, the last option. The option you only take when you're blown and you need to get out without ever being found.

I've personally helped a lot of criminals, from petty to nationwide wanted, to disappear and live on a new life, new identity, nothing connecting them to their past. For the past decade of being the disappearer, I've dealt with a ton of people. I'd know if they were trouble and will refuses to do business with them, sometimes.

Like this instance. 

The client are a very famous criminal underlord, with the name "Gellen". He made his name known without his face ever being seen, like he's some kind of Keyser Soze or some shit. I didn't care, I also have my own reputation, and if he messes with me he'll have the entire criminal element (or even some of the higher ups in government) of this country to descend on him.

Gellen wanted me to vanish this boy, young adult, probably not yet in his 30s, middle 20s is my guess. He looked like he was put here against his wishes.

"'lo boy." I said, greeting him. "Let's get to the point. First, what's your name?"

He looked uneager to answer. Eyes wild, probably looking for a way out, but he won't get out when he's still being held by Gellen's underling. "Clark."

"Okay, Clark. From the looks of this, you're not here because of your own accord, yeah?" I continued. "This will be your only warning then, pay attention."

His eyes are still wild, so I slapped him.

"'ey! You won't find an exit, even after your two 'pals' over here let you go. Stop resisting this. You're here, and now you're going to have your new life. You're no longer Clark, your new name will be ready for you as soon as we have the appropriate assets ready." I rambled, then started grabbing his hair and make him look at me.

"Let it go." I said, stopping at each word forcibly to make a point.

His face is still rebellious, he doesn't think I'm that menacing. Yeah, sure. I didn't look at all menacing, what with my thin stature and black bag under my eyes cause of my lack of sleep. He's underestimating me.

"Suit yourselves." I let my grip on his hair go, and gestured for his 'pals' to let him go. "Payment to the regular account, I'll let you know through usual channels about the status of this one." I point at the young man.

The grunts let him go, and as soon as they do, the young man charged at me. I let him grapple me, his arms on my neck constraining it.

He finally talks after saying his name, but towards the two grunts that held him before. "Get me out of here! I want to talk to Gellen." He said, reasonably calm. But still I detect a panic in his voice, which is intensified afterwards because he said "Where is she?!".

The grunts just turned around and didn't even look at him.

"Hey! Do you hear me? I'll snap this dude's neck if you don't tell me anything!" He shouted, more panic bleeding to his words.

The grunts just take the exit to this chamber, invisible unless you know its place, and the chamber is still.

Clark seems to know that there's the exit, and loosened his grip. Big mistake.

I trip him before he started running towards it, but before he falls completely I take his hand and put it on his back, then I pushed him downwards. Like how cop arrest people, but only one handed version of it.

"Urgh." I heard him speak, and I take out a ziptie from my pocket.

"Stay still." I say after he thrashed around, trying to let go of my grip. He must've thought that I have a weak grip. "Stay." I said, kicking him in his side. "Still." I continued, finally finishing tying his hands up.

I sat him up afterwards, leaning towards a wall. Then I began again.

"Alright, boy. You and me are gonna be close for a time, so I will be pleased if you don't try to escape for now. Gellen promised to pay a lot for your disappearance, so just accept it and live your new life, alright?"
I said, nonchalantly. "I'm calling you boy, and you'll call me Dude, alright?" I continued.

He didn't respond. He didn't even look at me.

"This is gonna be fun."
