A pen in black stroke the white paper, pure of speck. It stroke and creates words that flows and fill the purity with beauty. The writer sits in the shrouded darkness, the light that aids them fails unexpectedly. The sounds of water hammering down his enclosure accompanied him and his thoughts. There were no one else. They focus on their creation, regarding the darkness and the soft buzz of rain hitting above their location as nothing but unimportant distractions.

The buzz temporarily stopped.

It ceases but they know it will return. They seize their chances, using the break to try giving themself the light back. The water is an annoying deterrent, and they don't really need the light, but the chance is there and they would not let it go away. A single flick, nothing happens. A continual click, nothing avails. One lucky stroke, and the whole enclave lights up.

They see their own table, that previously were hidden by the darkness. A single brush, laid bare stuck on a cup of black ink. A white paper, almost as wide as the table. Nothing else, the table were wooden of a great quality. The whole enclave were also visible. There were four corridors in front of him, his back were walls of rock that is neither jagged nor soft, spread evenly on a semicircle. The left-most corridor were filled with the sound of howling winds, the leather drape that covered it were shaken vigorously. The rain was coming from a distance from that corridor, their winds are close enough to hit the drapes. The other corridors were also covered in similar drapes, the only difference is the color on the right most one was pure white instead of the usual brownish leather color.
