My name is Mick. I'm an adventurer.

I've seen many wonders in this new world that was hidden before, the worlds that lives parallel with us, the world that exists outside of the definition of 'normal'. I've battled creatures that would probably make a normal people faint, dangerous ones that can kill without any warnings. I've seen worlds where the dead were the ones walking and the living is the one who were buried. A world where there's nothing but sand, a world where there's nothing but sea or a world ravaged in lava.

I'm not some kind of amateur who travels the world on his own whims, without any plans or any research, or any semblance of preparations.

But I am the kind who travels the unknown, the worlds untouched by the governing inter-world organization that held the grip on the inter-world travels, and document the worlds to my own pleasure. That pleasure includes any parties that are interested in getting my information, preferably those who gives a lucrative offering.

Even I know that the preparation I need to travel these unknown worlds will require some kind of money.

In the years that made me a reputable adventurers, I have reached a point where I rarely seen things that surprises me anymore. But my life is hopefully long, something will surprise me once more.

And that something is probably in the next place I'll travel to.

I heard chatter about a new exploration site, a world officially designated as Islandworld-2, the first parallel world of the Islandworld or also known as Islandworld-1. 

Preliminary scouts by researchers reports that the world is not populated with islands like the Islandworld-1, but instead there is a major continent on the world alongside small islands. The terrain of the continent that was observed by the analysis drones suggest that it was filled with forests and swamps, with odd structures placed in several places. There was also no known civilization or sign of human activity other than the possibly man-made structure, and the drone also reported strange anomaly that can't be explained. (a creature with size akin to the Oceanworld-4's massive Sea Travelers.)

Islandworld-1, when it was first found, was considered to be a gold mine for some specific industry. So, knowing that there are another parallel world of that, I know that information about this new world will be valuable.

There is a lot that technology can do, including mapping the whole world and a lot of data that certain company can use to determine the wealth of Islandworld-2, but even the most advanced technology aren't infallible to error. 

And that's where we came from, adventurers. We are the one who scour the place on the spot, looking at it with our own eyes. Our observation up close can validate those data and also tell a lot about things that technology fail to analyze or detect.

With that information, I prepared some tools. Weapons, both melee and ranged. Appropriate tools for the terrain, some heavy boots and a backup pair. Survival tool kits. There's a chance I'll get stuck and I can't go back towards the known entry points to the world for days. I learned about that the hard way when I first explored Oceanworld-4 back when I was still amateurish. And of course, a grappling hook. Generic, but you would be surprised with how useful the thing is. It doesn't help though that every time I used it, I felt like one of those characters from movies and video games, and I cringed every time I remembered that.

I packed everything to my backpack, and set off from my base, located in Skyworld-1. A world where civilization lived in floating cities. I walked towards the headquarters of BOOTHes, the previously mentioned inter-world organization that is responsible on controlling inter-world travels. BOOTHes had a R&D division that has many goals, one of them are finding new worlds to travel to. This is where I'm going.

I specifically bought a place in Skyworld-1 because of the strategic location near the HQ. As soon as I started rolling in cash after selling my first validation data to a company, I know that my life would be much easier if I live near the place.

I reached the lobby of the headquarters in about five minutes.

"Hey Mick. Here for the R&D again, I assume?" A blonde receptionist, Milly is her name, stroke up a conversation as soon as I reached her desk.

"What else would I be here for?" I replied.

She looked at me with her eyes glinting. "To see me, maybe." She smirked.

I am aware of the effect I had on women. All adventurers know what's up. I smiled and said, "Well, I'll need someone to talk to after this particular journey, I suppose. You down?"

She handed me a card, an access card for R&D division, and says "You know my numbers already. Call me." as she winked.

"You got it."

I walked towards the next


The entry points to the worlds are found within the bounds of its known world. These entry points is what scientific people, and science fiction lovers, called a wormhole.  The entry points to the Oceanworld-4 were discovered in the remote location in Oceanworld-1. Mountainworld-2's entry point was at the tip of one of the biggest volcanic mountain at Mountainworld-1.

It is still unknown how those entry point even exists in the first place, and frankly I don't really care about the science behind it all. I just know that science took a backseat when you found out that there are worlds out there that shatters your perspective about the whole universe.

We weren't the first one to discover these entry points however. A civilization of people who can bend elements have made contact with us through an unknown entry points that they politely refuse to disclose. The only known fact about it is that the point is somewhere in my home world, the Earth. Or rechristened as the Earthworld-1 after the discovery of parallel worlds and other worlds.

There's also another civilization who discover these entry points, but they're nothing but peaceful. They came during the early days of exploration, on the Skyworld-1 where we successfully made contact with the original civilization that lives on top of floating cities, that was created to escape the uninhabitable world down below them. During this contact attempt, the civilization from the world designated as Skyworld-13, invaded the floating cities of Skyworld-1. 

With our timely help, they managed to held back the offense and strike back at the invaders. This event is to be known as the "Invaders of the Sky" event, and most of the technology the invader used are reverse-engineered by Skyworld-1's community of floating cities and by the governing inter-world organization to further accelerate the growth of the civilization there. The organization were even allowed to set their HQ there, as a gesture of thankfulness.

The dangers of these new worlds is also what made adventurers exists. They became the one who extends the known civilization by exploring these new worlds, and they brave through the worlds while knowing how dangerous it could be. They also became the one and only choice for company to get valuable confirmation of data about the new world, and the dangers that exists there. 

I never once thought that I would be an adventurer growing up. My mom is a housewife and a devout follower of the Creator, and my father is a regular accountant. I heard a lot about how adventurous they are when they were young, but they never look more normal in their later days. 

Then the world wasn't just the Earth, and I found myself eager to go see the new worlds for myself.
