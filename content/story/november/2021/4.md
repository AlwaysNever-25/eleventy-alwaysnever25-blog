When pigs could fly, anything is possible. When I say anything though, I mean, the most unlikely things occur, replacing the likeliest thing to happen, as if the world is having a reverse day en masse.

Nothing you know matters anymore, the only thing that would happen is the one that shouldn't, or at least, least likely to happen.

Four legs on a human. Three people simultaneously winning a jackpot. A very determined person finally get the break he needed on his investigation on how to travel to other worlds. Oh yeah, it's all coming together.
