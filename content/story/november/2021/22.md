The autumn wind blew over like a hopeless dream, taking me with it to the bleak sky that turning grey the more I look at it.

Why am I so melancholic? This shit is reserved for goth girls, and they're already extinct. Back to the real world. I'm standing outside my universities' building, or one of them but this one specifically is where I'm having my class. It's the first day of class after what could've been eternities waiting for things to be a little bit... peaceful.

It's been so long since I have to live in a world where I can't go out without risk of actually dying, unless you wore a mask. Now the risk has been mitigated enough that I don't have to fear, but it's still hard to readjust back to normal, to what could've been the norm if people could just listen.... I'm straying.

I look again at the sky. It really does look grey, probably meant that it's gonna rain soon. I take a gander on my phone, and see that the time is 12:55 PM. Class is starting in five minutes, and I hurried in. I stopped before not only because I was so unprepared to go back to what it was, but also because I couldn't believe that I will have to go through all of this process all over again.

All. Over. Again.

I picked this option, yeah. I picked this, and I should sleep with the decisions I made.
