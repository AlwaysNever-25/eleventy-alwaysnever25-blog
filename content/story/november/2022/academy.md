Sunlit Academy opened its gates right before the dusk sky grew into its eternal brightness.

The pearly building was constructed with the only stone available for the civilization living under the eternal sun, the brightstone. White as quartz, yet as sturdy as a brick, it also has yellow wire-like structures built-in to them that pulse defensively, as the current Light Knight on duty stands tall atop the building, holding on to a strange unidentified item, possibly his Channeling Item. A raised platform specifically made to Channel their Por made them a sight to behold for the new students currently making their way inside.

Jin was one of the students, looking up at the Knight in reverence before he caught himself and looked around. He noticed that everyone else at some point are also distracted by the Knight, so he allowed himself to gawk.

The Knight himself did not wear any heavy armor, unlike the picture he saw of them flying around in the Lasoc, but instead, he is wearing a tight-fitted shirt that seems to glow just the same as the walls of this… damned academy. Thinking about the Academy brought Jin back to his senses as reality finally kick in.

Light Knight… I will be like that Knight someday….

He clutched to his side as he pictured the item that he managed to get at the Trials. He did not remember much of the Trials after seeing his mirror self’s glowing bright eyes, only the item popping up in his mind after the Light Priest woke him up.

And of course, the Light Priest’s debrief.

Do not talk about how you successfully managed the Rite if you remember how. Do not make the item, whatever it was, before your first day in the Academy. Do not pursue any dreams offering power following this Rite. And do not, for any reason, enter the Dark Territories until you graduate.

Keen remembered the “order” clearly. Four rules make room inside her crowded mind as the shackles on her feet and hands rattled throughout the walk back to her cell. They decided to shackle Keen after she punched the Light Priest as soon as she woke up from her Trials.

She also made sure to check herself, there’s no telling that she wasn’t… she didn’t finish the thought. There’s no way she can conceivably tell, anyway.

Keen remembered the rules for days as she toiled away in the cell, while she talked with her cellmates, during the break with everyone else in the “Correctional Facility”. She was sure that the rules also rattled inside her fellow prisoners’ minds, some people even began drawing things on their tables, scarring the pearly white stones with their utensils, just so they can get the image out of their minds.

“You got any dreams, Keen?” Keen looked towards the source, a fellow prisoner. Not just any prisoner, however. The uncrowned king of the male prisoners, at least on this block. Jadey. He’s also a friend of hers, which made her the butt of many crappy jokes with the other female prisoners, but like she gives a rat’s ass about that.

“What?”

“Dreams. Like the Priests said, y’know? Offerings, whispers maybe?” Jadey swiped his long white hair back as he sit across her, food on his plate.

“No, not really, why? Didja?” Keen answered honestly, although she does have nightmares, it does not contain offerings or whispers.

“Course not. Just wonderin’.” The green-eyed himbo said before he goes back to eating his fill. “Ya got plans for the items?”
Keen then remembered the item that popped out of her mind, the one that finally got her attention after her rage-filled struggle and punch. Her face darkened.

“Have no idea how I’ll make them. You?”

Jadey snickered as he finished his food, giving her a sly smile. “Well, if ya got problems with that, I’ll be available to help.”

“Of course, I can always depend on ya, for anything,” Keen said with some sly grin back. He stands up and kept smiling, before heading back to meet with his mate. They already uproariously give their leader some whistles and teasing remarks, which made her eyes roll a bit. As her eyes wander, however, she also then notices the bitches giving her daggers through their eyes. Keen flipped them off before she finished her food and joined their table.

“Okay, lay off the daggers, bitches. He’s just talking to me.”

“Oh yeah? You sure you’re not fucking him as well?” The biggest bitches of them all piped up to my explanation, my other friend and cellmate, Lea. The short-haired brunette raises her eyebrow with a smug smile as she said those words.

“Like hell, I would! Where would we do it, anyway, Lea?”

“Anywhere not on our bunk could be a start.”

“Bitch, you know I didn’t, stop with the lies.” Keen punches her in the shoulder, lightly of course. Lea laughed, and the rest of the table joined her.

“You’re lucky we’re not coming for your ass, Keen.” A lanky blondie, Germa, smirked as she ate her food slowly. She always does that, eating her food real slow, even when she’s alone. “Thankfully, he’s not worth killing for.”

“Ain’t nothing worth killing for, Gee. Now go eat your fill.”

“Ugh, I am,” Germa said exasperatedly. “I just like to savor it, y’know?”

“There are only a few more minutes to this lunch break, Germa. You should finish it by now.” A cool voice piped up, coming out from a red-haired punk girl with a sidecut. As usual, Jane Doe sounds cool and controlled, unlike her appearance.

“Fine,” Germa said as she stared daggers at Jane before she stuffed her mouth with the rest of the food. “Mom.”

Jane give Germa the barest of smiles, her way of being smug, as she finished her own food. Keen and Lea already finished way earlier, food is not meant to be savored, they would both say. “So, we still on about the Academy stuff, yea?” Keen said as she opened the portion of their daily routine, the plan talk. They’ve been doing this a week before their formal induction to the Sunlit Academy, which would be tomorrow now. “Lunch together, study together…”

“Yeah, yeah, fight bitches together too, I’m still in,” Lea said with a lazy wave as she leans her chin on the desk. Gee nods as she continues chewing the last of her food. Jean’s head tilts as she looks at Keen. “Keen, are you nervous about the Academy?”

“H-heh… Really can’t hide anything from ya, now, can’t I?” Keen chuckled nervously.

“You do not have to worry, Keen. I will always be in your corner.”

“Yeah, bitch, what are you being nervous about? Don’t you tell me you believe what those wardens said about the school?”

Keen frowned as Lea hit her with a left hook equivalent of a sentence, immediately noticing what she was worried about with such precision. “S’not an unreasonable worry, right? They say we be competing with--“

“Snobby bitches.”

“More like arrogant pricks,” Germa added with a snicker.

“Pretentious bastards.” Jean nodded with resolute.

Keen giggled as she listened to her clique bashing the Academy students. “Sure, y’all, they’re all that, but also, you know, even haughtier bitches than the one on that table.” She then pointed out to the table near Jadey’s, filled with every other girl in this prison, looking… no, fawning, over the boys.

“But Keen, it is inevitable that there will be conflicts between us and the students. I am certain that the boys are aware of such possibilities as well.” Jane said as she look at the boys’ table. Her demeanor mixed well with her already cool appearance, but Keen does notice her lingering look on Jadey, while Germa looked at every boy shyly. Lea basically leers at the boys, probably hoping one of the looks this way so she can give them a wink, which does happen. Keen rolls her eyes.

“Yeah, plans made for that reason. They’ll have more stuff than us. Probably better training too, they’re gonna try to quash us, somehow. Adding more pain to those fawning bitches trying to bring us down…”

“They’re more likely to try to bring you down, to be honest,” Germa said, looking sideways at Keen.

“Eh, expected. They can try any time, they know what happened to the last person that did…” Keen smiled and give a wave to a girl who give death glares to her, wearing a bandage on her shoulder and jaw. “Not sure I’ll be able to do the same to the snobs, though.”

The girls nodded to themselves. It’s probably guaranteed a death sentence if they tried to make a fuss during the Academy, not just even for themselves, but for their peers. 

“We gonna need to figure this out with the boys too. They’ll probably be going to be hit the hardest too, probably has even less temper than Lea on a bad day.” Keen said as she patted Lea’s shoulder, who lightly slaps it away.

“Heh, another ‘general assembly’ for the Juvies?” Lea said.

Jane sighed as they reach a conclusion. “Hopefully it goes better than the previous one. I do not like to see one of them spit on my face again, even if it was unintentional.”

Keen sighed as well. “Hopin’ the same, Jane.”

Jin arrived at the general assembly for the new students with trepidation. It was held in an auditorium, which reminded him of his old school assembly, crowded and busy, with everyone else talking to themselves. He is the first of his class to arrive, as the assembly is starting in about less than ten minutes.

“Huh? Where the hell…” Jin begin looking around, at the crowd of students already beginning to arrive at the assembly. Not all of them are together, it seems, and he looked at those who came alone with the best look of sympathy he can get. 

Then suddenly, a large crowd of students entered the auditorium. This crowd does not look the same as others that came in disparate pairs or groups. They can fill up a whole class with their numbers.

Notably, they also wear some very fancy uniforms, embroidered with techs that he knew cost a fortune, especially in these trying times, no matter how much they tout it to be peacetime. His heart sank as what he can only describe as “Rich Kids Posse” began walking towards his class’ spot, confirming his worst nightmare.

“Yo, you’re from our class, right? Class Sun?” The man in front of the group, their leader perhaps? He approaches Jin with a pearly smile and smooth movement. His black hair is expertly styled, or at least looks clean, his obsidian eyes full of attention to Jin as he offered his pale hand up for a handshake. Jin took it as he piped up.

“Introduction. Eloinde Kestrel. Kes should be fine. Yours?”

“J- JT, my name,” Jin said, a bit awkwardly. A new nickname he’s prepared to give to the students, a new nickname he intends to live with for the rest of his time here. “And yes, Class Sun is here.”

“JT?” Jin can see the illustrious boy raising his eyebrows slightly, but the follow-up questions that Jin feared never came to pass as he continued. “Well met then, JT. Hope you are okay with us taking the rein from here?” Kes the leader said as he gestured to his friends, who did not introduce themselves or even notice Jin. 

They started slowly encroaching on the spots all around him, and Jin find himself surrounded by people he doesn’t know about. There is a red-haired girl beside him, and a tall black-haired boy, who fiddles with some kind of device. Both of them speak to others beside them, the red-haired girl talks to a group of other rich-looking girls and boys, and the tall boy is speaking to himself. A cursory glance at his ears does reveal to Jin that he is talking remotely to someone.

Between them both, Jin can only talk to one of them. He mustered all his courage and asked… the girl. “Hey… sorry for interrupting. You guys already know each other before this?”

Jin hated himself a little bit as he looked at the expression of the group. Surprise and then followed by disdain by some of them, particularly from those with glamourous clothing and top of the line tech adorned on them. He grits his teeth to force a smile through, he has picked his poison, so it’s time for him to endure through it.

The redhead looked to Jin in a rather curious manner before she replied. “Indeed, we have. I heard your introduction with Kes. JT, wasn’t it?”

“Yes, I am JT, pleased to meet you all.” Jin act his best as he offered handshakes to everyone. Not all of them are so kind as to reciprocate, but he covered awkward moments with what he think is half-baked jokes. “Don’t want to stain that mechGloves with sweat, I understand.”

The redhead then introduced herself as well when they shook hands, “Tiri, it is a pleasure as well to meet you, JT. Thank you for holding down the fort.”

“It’s nothing much, just being here first. Oh, and you can continue your conversation, I didn’t mean to interrupt.” Jin said as he started to pay attention to the conversation and let them continue, but it turns out his appearance changes the topic completely.

Tiri waved him off and say, “No, no, you should know everyone first. Here’s Holly, Gorm, Boleah…”
