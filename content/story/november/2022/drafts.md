Jin wishes his idyllic life would end. No, not with something graphic like suicide, he just wishes for it to be interesting for once. 

The capital of the Light Cities, the last bastion of this world shrouded with darkness, was nothing short of boring to him now. It might have looked like the most interesting thing to him when he moved here with his family years ago, but now, it’s starting to look like an eyesore.

From its pearly white appearance, the people milling about using their personal hoverboards, walking about, or some rare appearance of Cars, retrofitted to fly as their rider powers it. It doesn’t surprise him or make him look in wonder anymore.

Especially right now, as he collected another part of the chipped white rocks, stuffing it into his bag. It’s a job that can usually be deemed as volunteer work, but apparently, the jobs are in such dire need these days that they’re willing to pay for it.

With Por batteries, no less. Something useful for him, who hasn’t gone through his Trials yet, or the more accurate terms would be “delaying his Trials for as long as possible”.

Jin frowned at the thought of the Trials and focuses back on collecting the rocks, hoping today’s haul will be enough for another one of the Por batteries. Gone are the days of him depending on his parents, who needed their energy to be sustained for the jobs they have already.

Then Jin felt his shoulder poked by someone. “Jin.” He heard the man speak, and then he turned and see his supervisor for the job, Mr. Kalle.

“O-oh, Mr. Kalle, sir, yes. Something… wrong, sir?” Jin spoke to him normally at first, before noticing that he looked anxious as if he was not comfortable with himself.

“Yes. Jin, walk with me for a second.”

Keen finds herself tired of having to run again.

Port Hope was supposed to be a safe place for runaway children like her, orphans, and disabled people, along with other less-represented people. It has the notoriety of being run by an influential person in the criminal underworld, who now actually became a legitimate mayor of the port city, after a successful campaign during her time there.

It was surprising to see it firsthand, criminals actually existing in the Light Cities, but she was glad that Port Hope is a place that exists. Otherwise, she has no idea where she would go to… escape.

Keen heard the sounds of steps closing in on her from behind, the Scout Knights, or just Scouts. Two of them. They wore a lighter version of the armor she saw of the Light Knights patrolling her area, and they want to take her in, like all of her friends that have disappeared in the past few weeks. 

Word on the street is that they’re forcing the lowlifes, urchins, and runaway children, to undergo the Trials.

No way in hell she’ll be fodder for the goddamn Order, giving years of her life to a service that’s no longer needed, and with that small failure chances…

Keen doesn’t even want to know how long she’ll have to be incapacitated in front of the Light Priest for the Trials. The mere thought of being so helpless makes her shiver, as she went past the crowded markets of this port city.

“Stop!” Keen heard the Scouts call out as she passed one stall, two stalls. She bobbed and weaved through the crowds, which seem to part for her slender figure, but as she started feeling like she could outrun the two of them, hiding in a nearby alley, she missed the silent approach of the third Scouts.

“Don’t move.”
