The black-haired boy’s eyes are cold and dead, and the device he is fiddling with is the same.

There is nothing but the device in his field of vision, but even he is unable to dampen his own hearing. He felt like it is a burden that is unfair to him, to be able to listen to everyone even when he wishes that he can’t. The words that some say not knowing that he can still listen, their true self leaking through the vibrations in the air, somehow his ears can reach them easily.

And so, his own crucible begins, again and again. For every criticizing and judgmental words he hear, his own conscience would instead join in piling against his own psyche. 

“He’s a little bit too quiet, huh?”

“Well, not when the teacher asked him.”

Of course, then they’re going to say that he’s a teacher’s pet. Or something else. They’re going to voice their displeasure over being embarrassed by the teacher when they weren’t paying attention, and then mock me for answering the question perfectly. Surely, they would.

“Heh? Really? Is he like, not talking to anyone else?”

“Even our Class Leader has stopped, from what I see at least.”

Heh, yeah, that guy. Eloinde Kestrel. He heard his introduction, remembered that he liked to be called Kes. He tried for about 247 times over this first month entering school. He admired his persistence, but the boy knows that all of this is just a farce. Kes is only trying to get to know him because he needs to, as the Class Leader.

They were wrong, however. He still tried to talk to him, just not when everyone was present. The boy again admired his tenacity, and wondered how the Class Leader knew that he preferred it to be that way?

“Really, even Kes can’t?”

“Yeah, stone cold. I mean, not like I’m watching him every time…”

“Who? Kes or him?”

“Who else, dummy?! Why else would I watch him?”

Yeah, why else would they watch him? He managed to keep his silence for over a month, at this point they really should just let go and take their focus somewhere else. He’s probably too weird, knowing answers to questions that the teacher always asked and answering it robotically, like he recited the answer straight from the textbook.

“I mean… we have to know everyone, don’t we? That’s the first thing they say we should do…”

“Yeah… we still have two months left, though.”

The boy suddenly stopped fiddling with his device, and he felt a sweat that wasn’t there started pouring in. This school… this damn preparatory school. It’s exactly why he kept his silence for so long. He doesn’t want to be here, he doesn’t want to be a soldier, and he wishes that by doing this, he can tank his chances, maybe get expelled.

“I’m scared, Tiri. If my trials went badly…”

“Remember what the teacher said. Don’t think about it, the more you worry…”

“The harder the trials would be, yes, I know.”

And after that, they just began talking to themselves, something about trials that the boy doesn’t want to hear. He, too, fears the trials. The unknown that lays before him as he would inevitably face them. All this silence act, he found, it doesn’t matter in the end, does it? His parents had already agreed, they basically give him away to “serve”, but he knows it’s only a farce. They can’t afford to have him in the house anymore, now that they have her sister. The golden child. The one they decided to focus on, knowing that the boy is the failed one.

The boy held on to the device in his hand, a prototype mechGloves. He wasn’t supposed to meddle with things regarding his potential Channeling Item, but he doesn’t care. Another form of protest. 

He slowly stood up while carrying his gloves and shoved them into his bag. He carried it as he heads towards someone, currently studying on his own pace. The class leader looked up, surprised that the boy approached him like this, perhaps.

“Perry?”

“Kes, we need to talk.”
