Jin woke up to see nothing but mists.

He looked around at the mist around him, swatting it around, and then stood up and walked around, seeing nothing but more mist. *Damn these mists*, Jin thought. He was under the impression that the Trials would be a bit less vague, and more straightforward.
The Trials, or its official name, “Rites of the Light”. His parents extensively talked about this, even more after Jin was “drafted” to join the damned Academy. His father, Hal, said that all he needed is to brawl with his other self before he was able to gain insight for his Channeling Item.

“You should be fine!” He said as he gave me a ‘loving’ pat on the shoulder. Did he really think that Jin would win? His lanky figure would surely get beaten faster than he could say hello to his other self.

Then again, his other self would probably be just as lanky, so his father might be right. As Jin thought about his father, however, the mist began to part.

Revealing what looked like his old bedroom, in their old home to the west, Port Botte, before they moved to the capital. The doors were closed, and there is no window. He walked around and toured his old life. His messy table, his toys, a secret cupboard where he kept his… ‘illicit’ stuff. Nostalgia hits him in a quick burst. But then he shook his head, focusing himself on the matter at hand. This is the Trials, there’s no time for nostalgia.

*What’s this going to be, then? Some sort of puzzle? Escape room?*

Jin then looked back and noticed the mist now has receded, gone from his eyes, and there was nothing but the room now.

*Oh, great. My Trials going to be like Mom’s, then.*

In comparison, his mother, Lin, spoke about how she has to go through mazes filled with puzzles and such to complete her Trials. He heard all about that half-heartedly, but he held hope that his Trials would be simpler and more straightforward, instead of being this convoluted, and complicated.

*Well, there won’t be a risk of me being a Lightless, I guess…*

Lightless, people that failed their Trials. It only happened in less than 1% of the participant, so not a lot of people are concerned about it. If they are that worried, they could always choose not to engage in the Trials in the first place.

That would’ve been Jin, too, if only he didn’t get drafted.

He couldn’t care less if he wouldn’t be able to power his own devices. Most of his peers think of how cool it was to wield the Por, how they shine brightly as they Channel it using their personal Item. They don’t talk a lot about the failures, the Lightless. How fucked they would be in that case, being basically the same as being brain dead.

Nothing in this world of his is worth being that. Nothing.

*But Jin… think about how angelic I would look! I bet you’d be drooling all over when I can Channel.*

He heard the specter of a lost memory echoing through his mind. A fool, tooting her own horns, aiming to be an angel just so that she can see him falling for her. He curled his hand into a fist, and the voice recedes as well. His thoughts would have wandered again before something happened.

It was a strange man with long dark hair, tall figures, and somehow similar proportions to him… oh. This isn’t a strange man, it’s just the same figure he would see every time he looked in the mirror. I guess his father is right, after all, he would be fighting his other self.

“Jin fucking Terrance, eh?” The mirror self said, leaning on the door. Ah, my sassy, sailor-cursing self that I always kept inside. Of course. “Seriously? You’re actually doing the Trials?”

“You really need to ask that? You’re me, you know why we have to do this.” The not-mirror-and-totally-real Jin said as he walked towards and sit on his bed.

“You could’ve just walked away, you know. You heard the--”

“I’m not going to be one of the runaways.” Jin cut his mirror-self before he can continue. The runaways. Drafted youth that chose to run instead of willingly submitting to the Trials. “I don’t have any darkness within me. If the Light Priest really considers being foul-mouthed as one…”

The mirror-Jin chuckled as he entered the room and closes them slowly. “Then the chances should be much lower than it really is…” The mirrored Jin then crosses his arms before saying, “So… what do you think we should do?”

“You’re asking me?”

“Of course. What, you think this Trials going to be hard? You’ve heard so many stories about it being so easy already.”

“I never heard of someone being able to choose what their Trials would be.”

“Well, it’s actually depending on the person themselves, maybe you haven’t been talking to the right people yet.” He shrugged before he began walking towards the pile of his “toys”. Gadgetry and games, mostly. 

“A round of LMM, then?” He pulled out an old console and one game from the pile, Light Makes Might. A game made by the Order themselves, featuring some of their famous Knights, even the Shining Lady herself, Lady Hyrra. It’s kind of a bad game since it was made by a governmental body instead of a proper game studio, but the kind that over time grows into a nostalgic hit somehow and made a cult following.

*Am I really going to go through the Trials by playing LMM?* Jin thought to himself, as his mirror-self prepared the console, plugging it into a Por-filled plug, and handed him one of the sticks. “This isn’t a joke, right?”

“It’s never a joke, Jin. This is, after all, still the Trials.” My mirror-self said, his voice suddenly dropping as he turned to look at Jin. Gone were the eyes that he thought were similar, and in their place, Light began pouring in. 

“You better play to the best of your ability.”

Keen wishes she can escape the mists.

She struggled to run through them, towards salvation, even when she knew there was none. It is happening. She is in the Trials.

“Please, somebody! Take me out! I don’t want this… I don’t want it!” Keen shouted to the void, somehow wishing that the Light Priest would hear her plea and let her out.

All she heard back is nothing.

“Fuck!” She curses out before she took off in a random direction. She needs to run, just like what she has done since the Light Cities ruled that they need to draft people into the Academy. Just like all her friends in the street have done, scattering like mice as soon as the Knight came knocking on their shabby tents and temporary homes.

*Come with me to DT, love. It’s dark, sure, but better than being stuck here and being a slave for them, eh?*

His voice filled her mind completely unprompted as if she would ever remember the fucking traitor that fondly. “Fuck off!” She covered her ears and kept running. 

The voices have been assaulting her ever since she woke up in the mists, droning on and on for memories she has successfully kept hidden inside. It is now spilling out like guts when someone cut open your stomach. 

*Get the fuck out of my sight, you filth.*

Another voice she would rather not hear infiltrates her mind when her ears are already clogged, but she stopped when she heard those, knowing something is wrong.

“She didn’t say that.” Keen lowered her hands and shouted to the void, to whoever is responsible for making these voices. “My mom didn’t say that you fuck!”

“Well, she might as well do, eh?” A feminine voice came out behind all the mists, a familiar one as if it sounds both deeper and shriller than her own voice. “After all, we both knew she doesn’t want a filth like us.”

A slim figure walked out of the mist into her vision. Straight brown hair tied into a ponytail, decently sized chest, prominent hips that now swayed exaggeratedly, and a smug face plastered on her mirror-self.

“I didn’t walk like that.”

“Oh? Didn’t you? I’m just mimicking the way you walk that one time--“

As if on cue, a voice started to speak in a deep tone, but Keen has had enough. She covered the distance between them and slapped the shit out of her other self, with a satisfying sound of clap.

That voice was the last thing she need to hear right now.

“Such power… So, I take it you’ll have the Trials this way?” said the sprawling mirror-Keen as she rises up, a smug look on her face as she balled her fist into a stance, just as Keen herself already prepared to do so.

“We both know it would be this way, don’t play with me.”

Her mirror self then raised her hands in mock surrender. “As you wish. And here I thought you’d probably be less aggressive to yourself…”

“What? You’re gonna say I shouldn’t be harder on myself or some—” Keen said mockingly before she was rudely interrupted by a clean jab heading toward her face, from the stealthily approaching mirror self. 

“You should’ve—” Keen was about to mock her some more, but the mirror self relentlessly pursued her and keep her in check with multiple kicks and jabs. At one point, the mirror self was able to execute a perfect flip, almost catching her in a surprise kick. She caught it instead, and complete her previous words, “You should’ve hit me earlier!”

Keen locked her mirror self’s leg and pushed her down, grappling her as she said with what she thought is the same smug face plastered on her mirror self earlier, “Sloppy.”

The mirror self looked back in defiance, before her eyes began to glow, filled with the very thing she hates most in this world.

And the thing she would receive when she triumphed over this Trial.
