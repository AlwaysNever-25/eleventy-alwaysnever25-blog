Two people who were attracted to each other, each unaware of the other's attraction.

It was the first day of a new semester in college, and two sets of eye meet each other in the hallway of a building. 

The guy was tall, his black hair is messy and his skin is lightly tanned. The girl was not short, but definitely shorter than the guy. Her hair is red as a tomato, wavy and compliments her face well. Both of them has beautiful set of brown eyes. 

They were on their way with their friend towards their own class, and it was just pure chance that their eyes met each other.

It was only an instant, not more than three seconds for other people, but for them time might just not exist. Or it didn't affect them at all. 

They tried to secretly ask their friend if they knew about the other. The black haired guy asked his friends, only to be met with confusion. 

The redhead girl asked her best friend because she realized that she went to the same class as him. The best friend is intrigued and realized her friend's crush towards this mysterious guy, no matter how hard she tried to be nonchalant about it. 

-----

The black haired guy keep his curiosity to the mysterious redhead in the back of his mind, and took notes of the lesson. The lecturer asked them to pair up with someone for the homework. 

Before he can ask one of his friend to be his partner, a short girl with straight blond hair sauntered to him and asked confidently towards his face to be her partner. Because he can't find any good reason to refuse, and his friends had found their partner already when he saw them, he nodded. 

-----

The redhead girl is deep in reading when someone sat next to her. When the stranger tapped her shoulder lightly,  she was surprised to find it was a guy she didn't knew. The stranger wore glasses covering his dark brown eyes. He also has light brown hair.

He introduced himself and ask for the girl's name. It was clear that this guy is trying to flirt with her, and she found herself compelled to lie and say that she has a boyfriend. But she didn't do that. She just said her name. 

Would you believe that those 2 interaction bring the two person further apart moreso than they ever realize? 

-----

Time passed and soon they have more to think about than the mysterious person whom they locked eyes in the beginning of the semester. 

The short blond girl, who turned out to be the best friend of the redhead, found herself also falling for the black haired guy. She realized that this guy is her best friend's object of instant attraction and she can see why. 

She felt guilty by falling to the same person that her best friend fell to, but it's not like she's still falling for him now. She have a boyfriend now, and because of that she was slowly letting go of the guilt she didn't realize she held tight near her heart. 

-----

The light brown haired guy find himself fascinated by the changes to his life by asking the redheaded girl to be his girlfriend. It felt more wholesome to him now, life is. 

There's a person who asked him everyday if he has eaten yet, ask where he was and what he was doing in random times, and saying good night before he slept every night. 

It also help that the girl is insanely hot, too.  But let's not focusing too much on that, because it was reserved only to him and his mind. 

He can see himself clearly being with her for a long time. 

-----

The black haired guy is conflicted. The short blond-haired girl and he were in an awkward situation. Especially after said girl kissed him last night during their research late at night in the library for their presentation. 

Granted, he didn't exactly stop her and they went on for minutes before he ended it reluctantly. Very reluctantly. Because no matter how much he wanted to continue, there are some tasks that they need to do first. 

It turns out to be a be very unwise decision, because they spent the next 15 minutes in awkwardness and both of them can't get any work done. He postponed the meeting to the next day.

The next day came, and the awkwardness is still in the air. But the black haired guy has decided to do something before they met today. 

He decided to try. And they did.

-----

The redhead girl was walking towards her class where her eyes met someone's.  It was the same guy, the guy she locked her eyes with in the beginning of the semester. The brown-eyed tall guy who she only met eyes with for less than a second. 

She found herself walking to him, and starts to talk to him. But the world suddenly turns bright and loud. 

Her alarm woke her up from the dream. Groggy and very tired, she turned it off and started to get up from her bed. 

5 minutes later she didn't even remember if she's dreaming at all. She went to a restaurant with her new boyfriend.

-----

The brown haired guy, that will be called Brown from now on, began to see the other parts of relationship that he never experienced.

Adaptation to certain traits of his girlfriend, and also how to resolve a fight.

The latter most definitely will be a skill worth learning for other things in life. It's still felt great, being with her.

He was on his way back after buying her a flower, but his eyes missed the speeding car that made its way into him.

-----

It was weeks after she started a relationship with the black-haired guy, and it was a great few weeks.

She felt all the love he felt towards her, but the past caught up to her. The past is trying to catch her up and put her again in the neverending cycle.

The past is her ex, and she was trapped already as soon as she saw her.

-----

The hospital is filled with many eyes,  but not many of them is the eyes of a happy person. You can rarely saw those when someone was told that they were pregnant, or the disease that ties them down is finally eradicated. Or even when a person in a deep coma suddenly wake up. 

But nothing of those examples happened to the eyes that we observed. The hair of the person is covered in a cloth, and half of his face is covered in a mask.

This person's eye were frantic, as he try to do his job. Saving a person that was laid down in front of them. The person was a surgeon.

The surgeon was on duty when the ambulance brought a person. Male, early 20s, caucasian with a brown hair. His eyes was closed so he can't see his eye color. The person was a victim of a car accident, struck down when he was crossing the street after he bought a flower. How does the surgeon knows?

The victim still clutches to the flower he bought.

-----

The redheaded girl couldn't shake the bad feeling she had at the beginning of her day.

The feeling keep creeping up on her as she put herself on her study, for the finals this week. 

The study requires no distractions. Period. So no smartphones, and no laptops, and no internet.

That's why the news only came later when someone knocked on her door. She opened it to find her short blond haired friend crying.

She cried harder than her friend when she heard the news.

-----

The black-haired guy accompanied his girlfriend to her friend's place. He waited in his car to let them have some personal conversation.

He heard the news from his girlfriend, that her friend's boyfriend was in a car accident and he couldn't make it.

She was informed because apparently his friends can't contact the girlfriend, so she went to her place to check and also give her the news personally.

He was reading from his phone when he looked up and realized that his girlfriend is back, with her friend.

It was the redhead girl that he saw before, back when they started the new semester.

His eyes was wide from shock, with hints of relief and curiosity. Her eyes were wide from shock, with hints of sadness and betrayal.

The short blonde haired girl looked guilty, but it's not the time to face her lies. Her friend needed her.

They all went to the hospital, to confirm the brown haired guy's identity. The girls hugged each other after they visited the morgue.

The funeral happened a day after, his family allows them to attend. The red-haired girl also gave a very tear jerking eulogy, about how much he meant to her.

About how every time he was able to save her. About how regretful she was about their last fight, and about how much she loves him.

The black haired guy held his girlfriend's hand. He gazed blankly though. His mind is elsewhere.

-----

The brown haired guy woke up to a bed, a cold feeling, and a clock ever ticking.

He felt like a wreck, but he stood up. He didn't remember how he got here. 

He only remembered that he bought a flower for her girlfriend. A beautiful rose, that he didn't have in his hand right now.

Where is it? And where is he?

-----

The black haired guy saw with his own two eyes, when her own girlfriend made out with another woman. A sad feeling crept past his mind, but it was his fault all along.

His thoughts were never really organized since the funeral. Their relationship deteriorates as bad as a corpse buried on dirt.

How can he not? He found out the girl that was stuck in the back of his mind after a long time, just to find out that she was griefing for another person in which she has loved.

He couldn't see her like that, so he did something. And he felt conflicted ever since.

A night to vent turn into something they both had kept from each other at their first sight of each other. Confessions, and a kiss.
