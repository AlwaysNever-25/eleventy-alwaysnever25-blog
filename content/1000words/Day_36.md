## Letting Loose

Rage deep untouched, let loose in a small burst, atypical of my usual observable trait. If unsatisfactory emotions were a droplet od water, it would fill a dam. If such a dam exists, it would be walled with my own self and the lies I've said. And if those walls ever break and leak that water out, there's always something to fix it. Usually it was my laptop. 

My internet addictions. It keeps me distracted, keep my thoughts away from those water and instead keep focusing on random things. But now I lost that crutch. That fix-it-all distractions that keep my water of emotions in was gone. And I was forced to confront with them all, culminating in one giant mishap of an evening. 

What should be an enjoyable night when I finally watched something that I've been waiting for turned into a panic fueled race against the clock night. Lax attitude that I inherited. This wouldn't happen if I was alone. I'll be late, yes, but I wouldn't be panic-stricken. I would be mad, a bit, but I wouldn't rage and shout it out in the middle of the streets for anybody to hear. 

I have issues. I can't keep blaming them, and I can't keep blaming myself. Now I began reading as a way to cope with the loss of a precious companion. But it'll never be the same. 

I hate this. I felt like I've been on the best years of my life and then suddenly it grinds to a halt and then I have to wait for the uncertain conclusion. Will it continue or will it stop? Will I finally be truthful to myself and see the rotten person that I am? Will anyone know and accept that?

Will I began to feel confident and start jumping into the water instead of looking at it from afar and wished I could have the confidence to just jump in?
