A thousand words a day.

Rules must be established. A habit like this can't be done freely, at least that's what I thought.

The first, you can write in the time-frame of midnight exactly at 12 o'clock, until exactly 24 hours after. Anything you write after the deadline must be put into the appropriate file, the next day file. This one is written in the 'Day 2' file, and there was a 'Day 1' file. The story in a file could be unfinished, ending in the middle of a sentence, because I am a professional procrastinator and only began to write this few hours before midnight.

Midnight Inspiration, after all.

The second, you are aiming for a goal each day. A thousand words written each day. This goal need to be reached each day, otherwise there will be a punishment. The punishment will be dealt in a review day, that happened in the 7th day. Review day will contain a review for the last 7 days, and will not have any impact on the goals. Reviews will be put on top of the day's attempt to write A Thousand Words.

The third, you have to write an appropriate marker if anything you write is going to be Stickverse canon. This rule is kind of adjunct to previous rules because of how it's going to be used, but please don't confuse yourself by not marking anything that can be added to Stickverse canon.

This established rules for now will count towards the aforementioned thousand words.

20 minutes until midnight.

A void hangs in between a life and a death. A never ending uncertainty. An oblivion that awaits in the afterlife that you never knew.

Thoughts of that sometimes ran through my mind, distracting me from whatever emotion I have felt. Feeling joy? I'll die maybe tomorrow. Feeling loved? Reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and it's only temporary before they started to hate you.

Life shouldn't be this way, isn't it? But these thoughts keep finding its way back to me, like an annoying catchy music from an advertisement, or a certain onomatopoeia from a song.

Let's think of something else.

A woman lied down on her bed, writing about her life in an anonymous social media. A sad story of self-hate. She felt trapped in a relationship she didn't even want to have, but she didn't want to let go because she knew the guy was better than most guy she can find in this world. Attraction is a funny thing, it depends on each people, and sometimes what you felt might be unreasonable and you hate yourself because of it.

She finds herself a distraction, another love. A flame forbidden, a guy as bad as your usual bad guy trope. Tattoo and a drinker, but she claims deep down he's a gentle lover. A wrong thing to say to a world where conservative values were what most people grew up with. Condescending attitudes rise up from the dreaded comments section, and it started to crescendos until I've had enough.

How a few word could make me feel sick of this country and its obsession to a values when most of them are following it because they fear of looking bad in the faces of God.

"Don't regret it later."

"Don't let your mind clouded by lust."

A quotes of scripture, dedicated to make them look like they're wise, but what could hide behind those profile picture?

What lies beneath those condescending comments? A shared pressure to not break a conservative driven values? A story, an experience? Because they have been where she was, and they find solace in lying to themselves and letting all of their problem go as something God sends their way so they would toughen up?

A nice thing that is, a way to let all your problem, all your fuck ups, to be a plan or some sort by God.

Otherwise you would think that life is meaningless, and resort to twisted things and dark thoughts. Thoughts about void and never ending uncertainty.
