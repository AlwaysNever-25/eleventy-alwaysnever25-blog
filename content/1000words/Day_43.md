My laptop crapped out on me for these past few weeks since I replaced my keyboard. I did wrote in between Day 38 and today, but I didn't actually distinguish what I've written. So I'm not sure I'll made one for 39 and afterwards. 

Met my friends yesterday though. Play some UNO on a cafe, then went bowling. Not a usual thing people do here. I mean, shit, I never bowled before. Funny thing is, even if I don't know shit about bowling, I still won when I played with also-first-timers friends. Kinda shocking tbh, but I think it was beginner's luck more than anything. Anyone can land a strike if they bowled straight to the center pin with enough speed.
