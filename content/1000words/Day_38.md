I'm breaking a well established sleep routine right now to write this, but I'm here just to give some updates over where is this project going. In the past week or so, I've been blessed with some great inspirations that made me able to write two projects with longer than usual word. I am pretty sure if it was measured, it would break the thousand words goal that I originally set to do each day. With that realization, I will let myself go at it when I'm inspired and don't push myself each day. I'm also facing internship in this last couple of weeks before I'll go back to college so I'll write in occasion and there won't be as many openings to write as usual. 

That ends the sort of mixed news for now. Great news, I have a functional keyboard now! No need to rely on mouse to write certain letters and numbers, and relying on copy-paste on other certain symbols (losing hashtag is certainly not helpful in D2).

Also other news, this project ends at a certain date. At day 70+ or something. This project was started as a way for me to fill my holiday with writing, and also as a way to test if my passion was truly into writing. I can't say for certain now, but it has been a pleasant month or so now that I've experience. Both when writing and also when I'm not writing. So, I can't say for sure whether or not writing is my hobby only or I am truly passionate at it. I can only live and figure it out as I went.
