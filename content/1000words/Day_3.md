A thousand words a day.

A purpose for me to write. I can't see my writing as the same level with many, many writers out in the world. Writers of any kind, novel writer, journalists, content creator who wrote scripts for their videos (you'll be surprised how many people can wrote pages about things better than I do right now).

My writing is not mind-blowing, nor it is evocative. It is also far from being memorable, but it is mine. I wrote it. Should I give a fuck about whether or not my writing reaches a certain standard? No, I shouldn't.

But lately I've been thinking that I'd rather forgoes my degree to take an attempt at writing for a living. But doubt entered my mind then. My writing's not that different from anybody else, it's not unique. My Stickverse is mostly filled with parodies or likeness of worlds I have seen or read before, and the story it contains is mostly caricatures of characters that existed already.

A is basically The Chosen One from Animator vs Animation videos/series. B is his archenemy, The Dark Lord, from the same series. Frozo-ferno or Freeze-fernus is Todoroki from My Hero Academia. I also stole the entire ideas of devil fruit of One Piece and distributed it freely on Stickverse as Power Fruit.

Purpose of my writing. Like I said, my writing isn't as thought provoking as most of poetry or stories nowadays. But it is mine. And I hate when I lost it, and yet it happened to me.

I wrote a considerable amount of thoughts today on my phone, that was now as gone as my ATM card. A single mistake cost me about hundreds of word, gone unread. Nothing that can bring it back. I am now trying to piece it together, I remember only parts of it, not the whole.

A muse about my purpose of writing, a question as meta as the purpose of life. Why do we live? Just to suffer. A quick juxtapose to my current predicament. Two people sat far from each other, but still on the same table. A guy, with his attention towards his phone, his eyes seem glued towards it as he seek for something, a feeling. A girl, who ate her meal, looked awkward as she sat alone with the guy whose name she might not even remember. We knew each other, or remember each other in passing. We have interacted before, and we met at Ramadan annually because our mothers were close friend. I distinctly remember a holiday far from here where we began to interact in earnest, but time has passed. Now we don't even remember each other's names, a connection only made because of our parents.  A bit of shame, really.

It was written with more grace before, but like the first version of Eminem's Stan's third verse, it was irretrievably gone. The muse was written in a delirious but very unique way that I cannot replicate anymore. I only remembered the bit about meta and that sneaky Metal Gear reference.
