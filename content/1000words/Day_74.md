And so I write this, a few hours from my departure from this city. With that, the holiday has ended, and so does the project that I've begun. Like all projects that has come to existed, it is a gamble over whether or not it worked. The projects, if worked, could be the stepping stone to bigger projects that I can work on, and this one is no different. It wasn't entirely worked, because the original goal of writing a thousand words each day doesn't managed to be done. 

I don't even think I have written a thousand words in a single day. 

But the words that I have written, are important. Every single one of it. Words that I have thought are incoherent, lacking perfect grammars, and sometimes even riddled with typos. But it is still of importance to me. It means I am lacking, and still capable of growth. I've been through some reflecting times over these 2 months, and also a few dramatic arguments, and this project didn't fully capture that. 

But through these moments that I learned, that when you got struck down, it is important to rise up again. No matter how cliched that sounds, you rise. Problems exists so that you can learn how to manage it, to overcome it, and afterwards became a better person. A better man. It is a hard road, yes, but the right path is very often always the hardest one. 

It is a long, very long war. A fight everyday. 

Never lose hope, and find a motivation. You are on the right track on that already, keep hoping even when it hurts. Because the day that you stopped hoping, is the day that you lose a fight, and it kept snowballing after that, and it will be hard to rise again. Stay strong, me. You are strong. Be strong. 

Parting words is always something sad. I'm writing this mere minutes before I board my plane, and I must say this holiday has taught me more about how being an adult is. Or how to think like one, or make people think you are. A different mindset. A single change that you might have think of already, but can never actually implement until you're ready.

Now go forth, and remember me. No, that's Clara. Or quote from "Coco", or its title song. 

Stop hating yourself and start loving yourself.
