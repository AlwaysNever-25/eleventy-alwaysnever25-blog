What is 'good'?

Is it people who act good in the present after realizing his past mistakes as a kid, when he/she was a bully who acts tough and did horrible things out of pressure and series of terrible upbringings and toxic friendships, and being remorseful and felt guilty because of it? 

Or is it people that have been good, or trying to, with terrible past of being bullied yet still standing to live in this crapsack world, with traumatic experience of facing kids who knows not one thing about what they have done, and now has difficulties with accepting that people can change?

Good can't be defined, because it isn't something you can define. People doing good now, acting good, representing good, doesn't close up the door on the opportunity that they will do bad things. A human is capable of doing things for reasons, and with individual reasons and many perspective, there is no way to determine whether people are right or wrong exactly. What some people see when a person who have done despicable thing that relates to their own problematic childhood, will make them think that someone was bad.

Tainted perspective muddled by their own experience. Nobody is pure because of it.


Written words because saying it out loud doesn't feel like enough, or irrelevant enough to the environment that it doesn't worth talking out for. Series of words blasted out of my mind, but it cannot ever really describe my thought process. Writing words were much slower than actually thinking, ergo reading books are faster than actually writing it.

Roads that you take to do the right thing are filled with many challenges. Doing the right thing is hard, it never was easy. So keep fighting. Giving up is the true failure, and I'm done feeling like I'm a failure. It is a process that perpetually on going, fighting to change and never become passive. Give me strength.
