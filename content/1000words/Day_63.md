Pages. (translated)

One.
Loving something.
Do we love it only in certain moments, or we feel it everytime?
An idea, ideals of someone, or the true person?
Is love an egoist emotion? When it was felt by someone but they didn't return it?
Questions that floods the mind, will gone as we love.
Never ever fade but vulnerable to monotony.
Written words can never truly say what we feel.
Connections made with meetings that was driven by chance.
A close feeling even though we just met moments ago.
Amidst the crowd, amongst all things, two eyes met.
And the owner of these beautiful organs stops as people pass by.
A meeting that happened because of many factors,
five cards talks and give clues.
In all life, this meeting will be remembered
as the one that made a savior possible to be born.


Two.
Twins that is not similar travels the world with connections that never wavered.
When one looks left, the other looks right.
Inversion that was so thorough.
Two worlds divided by one thing.
I am him, and he is me.
A reflection of self.
But.
I hate him, and he hates me.
Born with wealth but cannot feel grateful.
An unchangeable trait, and the circle of life keeps repeating.
The inherited and future generations, will probably stays the same.
Living with the lie that he will be different.
But the truth will never go away.
In the time I can't act tough,
it will come.
Basic traits.
Unchangeable.
It came again.
Help.



Three.
Words that haunted your life.
Written or voiced, nothing were different.
Words that was utter without meaning can give burden to the one receiving it.
But burden exists to be lifted.
And one of the way to lift those burden is with words.
Circle of thoughts that happened again.
Isn't silence a burden?
Words that weren't said transformed into burden.
That in the end will be uttered in the most inappropriate time.
I love you, said someone to her married friend.
I miss you, said someone to his ex on her wedding day.
Let's break up, said someone as an answer to a proposal.
Honey I'm pregnant, said a wife to a husband who has lived knowing he's impotent.
Living yet haunted by three words.



Four.
Lives filled with order and structure.
We all need border.
(WIP)

FOUR.
Life free of creating
nothing limits you
(WIP)

I've written in my mother's language these past couple of days. I will try to translate it or bring it in it's original state to these files. Also in the progress of creating videos of the recording of select few of these files to be posted on Instagram! xxx is the profile. Cheers!

(2024 Al here, for privacy's sake, I'm censoring the account. I'll put it back when I feel like it.)
