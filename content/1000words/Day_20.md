A spell that repeated itself over my head like an echo on a cave.

The truth that came out and the unexpected support that I get.

A shell breaking? Or a slight opening?

Who am I but an amalgamation of every single person I respect and wanted to be? A catchphrase from a famous person. A conflict as my own ego, inherited from my father, tried to jump out again and again, but yet I kept it down. However it still manifests in the self-neglect that I'll inevitably return to, when I don't have anyone to control me.

A lie that'll never come out until they or I die.

A book about three kids and parallel worlds. A continuation, a break in between the series. I am a consumer of these stories, the childish-like intrigue, that I kept puzzling over. An inspiration for me to write, but it didn't help me in my motivation to keep this project going. 

Can I blame my keyboard on this? I can. It certainly is uncomfortable to depend on your mouse to write certain letters. I was lucky that one of them is rarely used anyway ('Q'), but this inconvenience still bothers me.
