A bright soul that one can observe through an eye, that lit up in the mention and in the feeling of a love. A lightbulb that glows and light the soul to the ever darkness that manifests all around him. That same bulb is affixed in every single person, but I can't help but felt that my lightbulb is dim. Observable as emitting light only in the extreme lack of light, in the pitch black of the world. 

But I'll never knew the true answer of the observation, because only an observer can reserve the answer that is true, unbiased, not clouded by the mind that kept bringing myself down.

Maybe it was all a lie? They sold you the ideas that there will be a person that will bring you such joy that anyone that observe you will be blinded by the radiant light that your soul emit, a product of swirling hormones and the vanishing despair as you realize you finally found the one?

An idea? I'll never know, until I find one.

A truth? It's relative, depending on the person that perceives it. I have found it before, but only realize it years later when I have walked away, so I can't say it's the truth. Some people wouldn't say it as well, because of their own experience and their own lack of belief and proof that it exists. But the others would say it's true. The one that have found it. They believe it exists because they have one, or used to be. They're hopeful that the world wasn't as bad as it seems, because someone has made it great for them.

I wouldn't even began to think about how easy it is to lose someone that had made such a profound meaning to our life. A single disease with no cure, a soldier dying believing he'll go to heaven by killing their enemies. A driver who decided to forsake rule and drive anyway in his current inebriated state. A malfunction of machine. A person obsessed. A mad man who decided that the world needs a little bit of cleansing.

A person with belief so strong he wouldn't consider the alternative that he was wrong. He's in too deep to atone.

A chase of euphoria, in an attempt to bring happiness to a body who wouldn't produce hormones that a brain would translate as 'happiness'.

I felt headache just thinking about it all, so I write. All these wandering thoughts. These drifters of ideas looping around my mind, filling it with complex thoughts that size rival the memory Google Chrome took when you open it in your device. Multiple tabs of thoughts pass by and left as I answered it with more questions. 

I've lowered my standard to anyone that approaches. Anyone. Not really, I'm still going straight. I might've been straying in other areas, but I'm firm about this at least. I'm not going to bow down to the new modern thoughts and let myself drop down in it and then I won't be able to climb out. The only person who knew more about me is me. I won't let anyone's judgement dictate what I will be. I'll probably let it affect me, but on that front I'll never let it change me.
