J. Cole responded to Kendrick's diss with "7 Minute Drill". Response is not as biting as I'd like it to be but wow, he really responded.

Spent some time on *Darkest Dungeon*, *Honkai: Star Rail*, and in my bed. I can finally rest after all these weeks of stuff I have to do...

zzz...

By nightfall, I also joined a karaoke event. It's been a while since I do that... it was fun, even though the event is now with actual strangers instead of people I've come to know and like.
