Got five LN series in my phone today:

1. *Roshidere*
2. *Eminence in Shadow*
3. *Higehiro*
4. *Aobuta*
5. *Re:Zero*

I wonder which series I'll finish before the break is over?

Finally finished Zom 100, one of the series I've been holding back from finishing for some reason. It was an okay adaptation by the end... the adaptation really is held back by the fact that their most interesting portion of the story happens early in the story, and also beyond what the material can be adapted at the time, so it's kinda stuck in a rock and a hard place. There's also the production issues...

*Salad Bowl* goes through the live of Livia as homeless, hostess, and detective's assistant, before back to being homeless. And also uhhh catching people cheating too. That was surprising to see... gonna watch this until the end for sure.
