Something to keep in mind in the future (I'm sure this also apply to guys... hopefully), credit to [VIVACIOUSHONEY](https://youtube.com/shorts/TpPVQ_IotVg):

If an outfit's not interesting through *color*, then it has to be interesting through *shape*,
and if it's not interesting by *shape*, then it has to be interesting through *texture*,

I'm hosting friends today, feeling a bit tired of all this stuff that I have to do. I have 6 days class, and on my one free day, my family monopolized my time as well. I'm starting to think I don't have time for my own, but maybe I'm just being ungrateful.

Anyway, friends coming over to study for a quiz tomorrow. It's about web development, so I'm not that pressed but it won't hurt to prepare.

It'd be depressing to have such bad communication with my own son in the future.

It's not like I see a future where he exist anyway...
