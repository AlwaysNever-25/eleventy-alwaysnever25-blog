Today I become an IT consultant again. I already spend some time back in day 29 to move my dad's PC to his employee's place, replacing her old Windows XP PC with my dad's. I don't really know why he decided to just use an old laptop with Windows 7 on it, the same one he brought on day 28 to fix. He really going to monopolize all of my holiday for his gain, huh? Sigh...

The problem that I didn't manage to solve back in day 29 persist, how to connect all of these PC together just like before, where they can just access each other through ethernet cable and router. It took me basically the whole day to figure out that Windows 10/11 and Windows 7 has a critical difference, specifically about how a certain features called Homegroup are removed from Windows 10. That got me thinking if the connection is still there, but hidden, which turns out to be true. I manually put in the PC name on the explorers for PCs that can't connect to the others, and turns out they can still connect. Them not appearing on the network is probably due to that Homegroup disappearing, because they were all used to be in part of the same Homegroup.

I also uninstalled some antivirus on an old employee who I feel like is one of my big sister. I also tackled with the old data that are filled with virus that was brought from the old Windows XP PC. I just fully trust Windows Defender/Security to do their thing, really. Reminder to self: NEVER INSTALL ANY ANTIVIRUS. They're no longer relevant, and just bogs down your PC.

After fixing that thing in time, I just spend the rest of the day working on *Mato Seihei no Slave* wiki, fixing their chapter titles and whatnot. Once it's time to go home, I volunteered to my dad to use the new LRT line that runs near the office. He actually brought me to the office using his car, but he has to use that car to transport my mom back home from the hospital. He then opt to bring his motorcycle back to the office, but he forgot to bring an extra pair of helmet. If I have to go back home with him, we might get in trouble.

Also, I really wanna see the big fuzz about the LRT, and maybe let my legs do some work.

The LRT line really reminds me of Malaysia's commuter line. The feel of the station, and the car... suffice to say, it was an okay experience. I wouldn't mind having this compared to using Transjakarta and having to wait for the road to clear in order to get to the next station.
