No class for today and the weekend... this is the prime time for me to finish all of the items on my list-

So... I listened to XG today. Kinda surprised to learn that they're Japenese girl group based in South Korea, with all of their song being in English (so far, from what I listened). It's an intriguing girl group...

I also have been playing Cookie Clicker for the past few days, but today was notable enough because I finally had enough cookies to ascend and started the chain of ascensions.

I mean just look at this:

Insane progress....

Childish Gambino re-released his 2020 album that was untitled, releasing it as "Atavista". I'm just jamming to it right now.
