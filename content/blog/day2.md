Learnt a bit about how to spruce up the website. Thank you, mentor.

Contracts are starting to shape up. I'll share my calculation on the EXP I'm getting here.

```
Base Contract : 500XP (First 60 chapters)
Staff Contract : 700XP (Season 1)
Overachiever (Base) : 50XP (next 60 chapters) + 50XP (next 60 chapters, currently it's 180 chapters)
Overachiever (Staff) : 50XP (Season 2) + 50XP (Season 3) + 50XP? (Movie? not sure about this)

Bounties:
S-Rank (Darkest Dungeon) : 1000XP (main objective) + 250XP (additional objective)
C-Rank (Rise of Tomb Raider) : 550XP (main objective) + 250XP (additional objective)
D-Rank (The Letter) : 400XP (main objective)
E-Rank (Magus of the Library) : 100XP (main objective)
    
Total: 
4000XP 
(or 3950XP if Movies not count)
(or 3500XP if I don't finish additional objectives)
(or 3450XP if Movies not count and I don't finish additional objectives)
```
