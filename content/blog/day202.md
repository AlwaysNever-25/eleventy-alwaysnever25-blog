Woke up to some news regarding the massive outing on enterprise level PC. Seeing all these blue screen of death affecting even the airport system made me glad that I did that bullet train trip yesterday, but it seems like our stuff did not get affected. Perhaps because the company behind this outing is not running a business here...

-----

Working on some stuff, and adding certificates on my CV following yesterday night... I don't know how to feel about this, I'm very late to the party.

Finished *Spy x Family Season 2*, and the ending is quite sweet, but there's not really anything left after this arc that they can adapt that would be as bombastic. The ending, I heard, is also filled with anime original stuff, which I don't really remember, but it's a decent one. I can't wait for *Season 3* and where they will take us, since the current manga chapters are quite disparate from each other, and I don't know if they can just adapt them... there's not really any good point to stop either...

Someone baited me to watch another anime this season, called *Bye Bye, Earth*. It's all because of this character. Everyone, meet Belle.

I told myself I wouldn't watch any more anime this season, but they keep coming with some stuff I'm interested in... meanwhile ATRI is still in my backlog cause I haven't progressed with the VN... sigh...

-----

Did an AMQ qualifier today, I got 5/60, seeding pretty low. Let's go me!

Remember *Biniku no Kaori*? Well, would you look at this title:

*Tsuma no Biniku o Masaguru Chichi no Futoi Yubi ~Shiranu Ma ni Chichi no Mono ni Natteita Tsuma wa, Yorokobi no Aegi to Tomoni Koshi o Uneraseteita~*

Yes, I'm reading this-

Okay, update. I cannot find any free source for this VN, so I can't read them. I do find some videos floating online though.

What am I doing? I should really be moving on with ATRI-
