I gotta read my schedule properly everyday. This is like, I don't know how many times this has happened. I got duped by the scheduling again.

I said to my parents that I had to get to my uni today, cause the class can't be attended online (truth). I said that the class that I need to attend is at 5pm, but there's still class before, so I can just attend those as well so I don't have to lose my online session allotment (truth).

What I don't know is, the goddamn class before 5pm is relegated into online classes anyway. Apparently it's their turn this week to be an online class. I had no idea. I'm already in my uni by 12 pm. 12 FREAKING PM. What am I supposed to do? If I'm in my normal condition, I can just wait in the library but my ASS IS DYING. The wind can basically topple my telephone pole ass.

So I had to call in some help. A friend live nearby, and he offered a while ago that I can wait there in this kind of condition, so I take his offer right now. He was accomodating, made me noodle and bought me some drink to alleviate my throat pain, and even let me sleep. What a stand up lad. I didn't really deserve all this...

Anyway, our impromptu "hangout" are also joined by another friend, who is also sick but he still strong enough to use his bike to come to uni (I cannot ride a bike in this condition, so I used Go-car). We talked about some situation happening today, coincidentally White Day.

Honestly, it kinda make me feel better on the inside too, hanging with these bozos. But I'm not gonna let myself be swayed by idealistic circumstances anymore. They're all just a dream.

Dreams make good stories. But everything important happens when we're awake. Because that's when we make things happen.
