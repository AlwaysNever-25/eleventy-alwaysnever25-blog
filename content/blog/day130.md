On the second day... okay, where do we left off?

Dreamflux Reef... yeah, I explored the whole region first before doing the story quests, getting all these birds and chests and whatnot. The whole story so far getting to this is... the best that I can say, is dream-like. Ethereal. And the story is also very dense, denser than Xianzhou so far. So many explanations about dreams...

Finished through a chunk of the story now, at the final stretch in the Grand Penacony Theater. 

Anyway, here's some Black Swan image to brighten your day!
