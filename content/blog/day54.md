Don't want to remember what happened during class today. Let's just say it's related to entrepreneur and how I hated it, and mixed with my sleep deprived ass.

After that, I spent some time in the library, napping, and ended up doing some wiki work. After that...

I finished Imosae vol 13... only missing the last bonus story that was a drama CD script. It was... once again... peak. This time, the focus solely comes from Miyako as we get to see her work on the very chill new competitor of Gift Publishing, Branch Hill Publishing. In here, she meet Itsuki's first love, Ayane Mitohara, and learned a lot about herself and her weakness.

While that happens, in the background we get to see some shenanigans with Chihiro and Haruto, having to pretend that they're a couple to save Chihiro's TTRPG club from destroying itself (like what happened to Haruto's), Nadeshiko now cosplaying and learning how to write (I am REALLY scared of her in the future), and a creeping sense of jealousy from Itsuki as he realizes something about Nayuta and Miyako.

This all culminates in two chapters. The first one is where Haruto not only reaffirms his love (in his own way, holy shit this dude... I kneel) for Miyako in a beer-filled date (just when I think this volume would not contain any beer that I can put on my [Imosae Beer page](https://alwaysnever-25.github.io/beer.html)), but doing so in a way that makes Miyako realize how hard she is on herself, and... I'm just crying slightly as I read that. He was acknowledging how he's not really Prince Manwhore as they all called him, denigrate himself, but then also resolve to say that he'll keep trying to make her look at him, and she finally did. Miyako... finally responded, albeit still a bit vaguely. After all this time...

And the next chapter is where the real climax happened, all of these chapters lead to Miyako and Itsuki's discussion in a swimming pool. After Itsuki gave his view of Miyako's strength, and encourage her to barrel forward in her own way, she decided that she wanted to be Itsuki's editor, specifically for the novel he wrote for Nayuta in the previous episode... the novel that was untitled at the time of their discussion. But after revisions and further discussion, he titled the novel as... *I Want To Be The Protagonist*.

If only I wasn't in public, I would have BAWLED my ass off.

The novel that pushes Miyako to want to be her own protagonist... the new draft even added more importance to a character that was basically a stand-in for Miyako, and she finally accepted that even though she doesn't view herself in such high regard, she can't really reject the version that all of her friends see of her. That moment... I was ready to call this another peak... it's peak...

THEN ASHLEY AND KAIZU GETS MARRIED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER. IT CANNOT BE MORE PEAK THAN THIS.

Itsuki's work on *I Want To Be The Protagonist* became his most successful book ever. (His new series called *"L-R Days"* that he worked on, moving away from his little sister obsessed passion, along with his *All About* and *Sisterly Combat* series gets a lesser success but good reviews overall as well.)

And that allows him to finally get ready for the next step, as he promised before to his beloved. And three years passed.... THE END?! I was floored when I get to that page, thinking that I got time to read more of the story (and peeped the total page, still totalling 30 pages), but turns out those last few pages are dedicated to the drama CD script. I was... livid, but not really angry. The story has finally reached it's epilogue, and everything ties itself in a neat bow. It's... peak...

For as long as I live, I'll probably never forget that phrase. 

*"I want to be the protagonist..."*

I want to be one as well. I want to be the protagonist of my own story...
