Today I witness a video about an election that got me scared. It was bad enough that I now am dedicated to actually vote, instead of lounging around and let the event run on its own. If this video-based accusation is correct, then I need to contribute in making sure that they do not win, so I would not have a guilty conscience once it's inevitably revealed that the whole thing is rigged.

It'll clear my head when I have to fight them later on, tooth and nail.
