Surprisingly has a competent performance for the exam today. Last minute cramming got me through the exam without the usual worry I have after these exams, but I'm not going to assume I get a particularly good grade... just not a bad one. I usually am worried about the grade after these exams cause I tend to just yap in the exam answer sheet instead of putting a proper answer based on the knowledge I would get from studying. Just logic and the vague explanations of the lesson with my own words. It usually is enough to coast me by, but I'm usually screwed if the exams need me to calculate something, which thankfully is not today's exam. 

That comes later.
