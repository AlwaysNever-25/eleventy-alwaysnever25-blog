Our *Sentai Daishikkaku* journey ends today as we watch the final four episode, I tried streaming it but my friends came over today, and the connection get worse because of it, so someone has to step in for me. Anyway, the last four episodes are as shonen as a shonen can be, as they all fight against each other, before fighting against one of the minion's boss, ending with... the death of Blue Ranger... man, the adaptation is good. 

It's not the best there is, but they definitely cooked. 

The OP and ED is absolutely goated too, insane production level from the animation and the music.

I cannot wait for Season 2... they already announced that out too letsgoooooo
