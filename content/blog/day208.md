Had to wake up early again today to take my mom to the hospital. Again, I shouldn't complain... but I joked to my mom that I feel like I'm the family driver at this point, and maybe I should wear some suit, like those driver you can see for rich people.

Anyway, yeah... kinda tired, so I slept a lot while waiting in the hospital.

I finally finished writing everything that happened over the course of the last month... I should really continue doing this daily so that I don't have to cram them like this, cause I think some of the things I write don't cover everything that happens during the day it supposed to be.

Anyway, if you're reading this, congrats! You reached the portion of the blog that I do write on the same day again!
