Swept through the majority of episodes of *My Dress-Up Darling*... as expected, it's peak story. I'll let the scenes of the anime speak for themselves. It's one of the anime that makes me glad that I downloaded it through fansubs and used mpv to watch it, because they have a specific feature that can take screenshots, and the quality is just... peak...

I'm gonna have to stop myself before I posted every single screenshot I took from this anime... it's truly peak...

Also before I forget, I used GJM fansubs (rest in peace) to watch this, and it was honestly very high quality, as always from the group. One of the anime I'm aiming to watch soon, Chainsaw Man, are also subbed by them, so I'm excited to see that as well!
