Started the Imosae Anime groupwatch early, knowing that I don't really feel like I'll be finishing Mato/CSM before I go back to college. First three episodes are alright, some things are reordered obviously, at least from what I remember, but the surprise was mostly coming out of the VA, cause I didn't think Nayu would sound that cute, nor Miyako, nor Chihiro... now I kinda get what Itsuki meant when he was working for his anime.

Okay, I watched *Spice & Wolf* remake again, and uhh.... what did I do wrong....
