After a ton of delay, we finally are able to match our schedule and begin the simultaneous worshipping of our goddess Holo... and also Rin Nanakura-

Before I posted some of the screenie for the episode, I do have something to announce, which is actually related to Holo as well. Holo WON the Best Girl Contest in r/anime, which was unprecedented! I only started following this contest since a few years ago, and am already aware of the Holo vs Megumin matchups that traditionally happen almost on every best girl contest... it was poetic that Holo beats Megumin again for the last time as she finally ascended from being stuck in the Best Girl contest, even better since Frieren and Maomao is coming next year and they're probably going to dominate the polls.

Anyway, back to some Holo and Rin screenie!

What can I say about Rin in this episode 3? Her smile is precious (irrefutable fact)
