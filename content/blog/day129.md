So... from today... I'm free again for another week... well, until Monday, at least. What do I do with all this free time? Well, I still have some animes I need to finish, mangas to read, you know, maybe I can even watch some movie-

*Honkai: Star Rail* just updated to Patch 2.2.

Okay, no, fuck all that crap, I'm playing this game until I'm done with the story missions. Goodbye world...
