My hands and feets are growning these red rashes that are painful when I have to walk or when I touched something. It's kinda ironic after looking for these symptoms... what the name of the disease is in my mother's tounge... referencing the problem that fucked me up... down to the tee. I feel like I wanna laugh but I still have no energy to do so...

Also, my mom made me the green juice for this enterpreneur class that I *had* to take to graduate. This is only the beginning...
