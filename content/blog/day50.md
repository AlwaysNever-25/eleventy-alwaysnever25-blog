I finished Volume 12 of *Imosae* today. It was... peak. It is designed to be, at least, after the downer of Volume 11's ending. It gets us through the months-long process that both Nayu and Itsuki take to get over their break up, and also nicely progresses basically everyone else's life. Reading Imosae made me realize that you CAN write something that jumps around a *ton* (if you don't pay attention, you'd miss how many weeks has passed from each chapter, something that the old speedreader me would do).

Each of the protagonists way to process their feelings are different... even though Nayuta getting the customary short haired post-breakup is... well, customary. What was surprising was that Itsuki also SHAVED his head. When I looked at the cover for this volume in the past, I guessed that these two in the cover was Kenjiro and his mangaka sugar mama, and we'll get to see the flashback for those, but I guess I was being a bit too optimistic. I should know that these two was actually Itsuki and Nayu post breakup...

They look so different though, in both demeanor and also visually.

We also get ASHLEY WITH KAIZU. FINALLY. Dear god, it only took her having a date with one of the new author to make her frustrated enough to just confess to him, basically. The confession was also very cute...

We also get some crowning moment of awesome from Kaiko, out of all people, and one heck of a "WTF" moment from Aoba... out of all people. We also get Nadeshiko exposed to the world of cosplay... I'm scared of what that would imply...

And honestly, the author managed to kinda scare me with the date with the actor Yuma... and also that Aoba moment. Good god, I had to put away my phone a bit thinking that the art wouldn't be that bad, but then I remembered that this is *Imosae*... (Nayuta with short hair and evil smile is eerie...)

The birth of Shiori, how Itsuki found her name, and his realization leading to him writing in his old style for five days straight... I screamed "PEAK!!!!!" and shed some tears. What a goddamn conclusion to this volume.

I wonder what is in store for us in the last two volumes...

Previously, on Dragon Ball Z. I recapped our last Dungeons and Dragons session to the two missing member. They also got loot, yay~

Anyway, now that we're finished with saving the town, we're now focusing back on our journey to the town of Kerpits, separated only by a river from where we are right now, a city... that I think is named Redwood Village, but I might be wrong. Anyway, we were debating on how to cross the river and such, since the bridge we needed to bring all of our possession across (carts, horse, Kibble the Sabertooth Tiger) collapsed because of the trolls.

After some exhaustive debate, we decided to spent our time in the town instead, doing downtime activities while we wait for the townspeople to fix the bridge (they said they would). I think this is the perfect time for me to *really* introduce the party, since I was really paying attention this time, unlike what I did in day 36.

Our party consists of six people. There's me, Krir, the Tortle. Also known as the damage sponge, the one who meets death, and overall... I even hate to say this cause I don't want to be, leader of the party. Yep, I'm the leader, somehow. We're all doomed...

Anyway, the next party member is Falgrand, our Twilight Cleric of Custom Lineage. He is vaguely human, if I remember correctly, and he's following the party because of the sigils on my shell that he noticed, after I was revived by Death himself during our first session. (It involves Krir climbing up a tree and WWE smashing his shell into an anvil, breaking them in two. Wild? I know.) 

He's our healer, and due to that, I keep making sure that Krir is always beside him, to throw some Protection Fighting Style disadvantage to any enemies hitting him. He's usually the one who thought of strategy while in combat as well, with knowledge on DnD that goes about the same as DM. The player who played Falgrand is also one of the three players who also played in another campaign, on a different day of the week, with the same DM.

Sadly, for this session he was unable to join us through the downtime activities, so Falgrand was Missing In Action as we go through the activities.

Next we have our sharpshooter, bow maestro, Ives. Honestly, his name reminds me of a character I know in an old DnD Twitch game, the show name forever lost to The Violet, but he's not a ranger. He is our main damage dealer in the game, with him always gambling for shots using his Sharpshooter feat. 

Outside of combat, he is known to be a mercenary, and have tried to "scam" people before. Krir had to stop him from getting physical with some people in this very session, but provided he was actually righteously angry because he thought he wasn't getting paid. He got a... thing with money, that's for sure.

Next we have our... okay, don't let him know I call him that. Our... cat, silent but deadly killer, potato eater, actually Tiefling but we forget sometimes, Beanerp, or Bean for short. He's our rogue that does feel edgy at times, but in this very session we can see him spending his time with cats, just patting them in the head. He does feel very random, and usually does not participate in most of the RP, but he has one consistent thing that uniquely identifies him; he has a magical potato that he carried with him from the first session. These magical potatoes has the property of enabling him to breath fire, just like a Dragonborn would, but with some kickback and quirks.

This "potato" proves to be clutch in certain phases of combat we faced so far, but he is also our Arcane Trickster. He rarely uses his arcane trickster stuff until very recently though, and now that he is level 5, his booming blade would surely be a force to be reckoned with.

After that we have our other silent type, the illustrious, the shapeshifter, Changeling that only recently started using their trait, Verniece. They (I'm unsure if they're using a specific pronoun or really using they/them, but because they're a changeling, I'll do the honor of referring to them as "they") are our Sorcerer, and is the actual silent type compared to Bean. They don't get too much into the RP, so much so that even the DM sometimes forget they're there, but a few sessions in and they have started to slowly fit in, providing a very good and needed clutch during our fight against the mutated troll with their cantrip.

Only until this session that I got to see them in action, as they were using their downtime activities to snoop around, and find out a suspicious group of people building a golem. They tried to infiltrate by posing as someone who left the group early to rest, pretending to be them as they watched over them and investigate. They even help them with the golem at one point, and get sniffed out as suspicious, but they uses her Suggestion spell to make them forget about them being suspicious, which somehow worked. Nice.

After a while, they found out that they're not really suspicious and the golem are supposed to be something that protects the town, and so their downtime activities went by. The DM really makes their ability shines here, which I liked. Compared to everyone, before this session, I know about Verniece the least, and this session was a good way to look at characters that might not shine as well before this. And this doesn't just apply to Verniece, it also applies to...

Their fiancee, Bruder! Well, that's what they introduce themselves as, anyway. They're not that lovey dovey with each other on the daily, at least. Bruder is our Owlin Paladin, and as a Paladin, their job coincide really well with Krir, who is also a meat shield. Krir and Bruder has some camaraderie going on, as he is the person that Krir has a friendly competition with during the first session, and in combat, we make sure to be the person who gets hit the most to shield everyone else. 

Other than that, he is (and I'm sure it's not influenced by the player herself) very fond of the mushroom that they acquire back in Day 36, and also very fond of Kibble, the Sabertooth Tiger that we picked up as pet in our earlier session. Bruder also helped around town during the downtime activities, insisting on doing that, even going so far as hiding themselves doing it until he was accosted by the townspeople who feels bad that they can't give him anything in return. Bruder then easily insist that they can prioritize building the bridge because that's what the party needs right now.

That should be all the team member... oh! Bruder and Verniece's players are the other two person who also played in another campaign, different day, with the same DM. Well, there's also the DM, who is also a nerd like some of us, and likes to make us roll dice... and especially make me roll dice since I keep egging him on a bit. Hehe.

The only thing I forgot to mention that happened in this session is that me and Ives went on a short quest, collecting a bouquet of flower that only grows in the middle of the river. The flower will wilt if it was ever taken away from the nearest stream of flowing water. This process of taking the flower in the middle of the river involves Krir being tied down with rope, that is tied to the tree, and proceed to swim/flap around against the rapid stream. Thankfully Krir is *very* athletic, so it wasn't a problem.

The problem does lie in bringing the flower back without it wilting. We had to go back to town and ask around about how to take them back, and were given a special vase that can flow water circularly and continuously, emulating the stream of water that the river provides. After that, we ended up getting back to the river and takes a lot of the flower back, and that was the end of our short quest.

After we all done our downtime activities, we decided (after a bit of the DM urging) to meet again as a party. Both Krir and Ives can't really find every member of the party though, even after sending messages through... an item they called Gugle Dux... yeah. So we search for them together, and found Bruder flying around with items as he was still helping around. We decided that Bruder can search for all the other party members in the sky, while we both can cover the ground. As the team split to do that, both Krir and Ives are accosted by townspeople, who mistook Ives as an infamous judge in the city, and forcefully pulled him away as I was able to free myself, but not able to help him.

The session ends there, as we figure out how to save our friend from being an unwitting judge... and the DM sinisterly imply that Falgrand might be the one being judged... find out next time, on Dragon Ball Z!
