Spent the day with my friends coming over today, and ended it with hanging out on a nearby coffee shop. 

Watched *Interstellar* again today. I still feel like that movie is the best movie I've ever watched.

Also finished *Ano Hanagasaku Oka de, Kun to Mata Deaetara*... I think. There's one more chapter that was untranslated, probably the epilogue, and Chapter 10 ends in a cliffhanger... dammit... the story is actually pretty heavy, about the consequences of war (especially to the Japanese populace during WWII) and romance between a kamikaze soldier and a time-travelling student. It's not that special, but I can see why this got a movie. The length is perfect for that adaptation. I just wish that they translate every single chapter...
