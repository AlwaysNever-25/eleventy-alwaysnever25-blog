One of these days, I'll forget that shapeshifting wolf's visage out of my brain. Their smug smile, the feel of their fur on my skin, lightly brushing me in their attempt to tease.

Annoying, but somehow I still remember them. How the sun seems to give them the best lighting possible, enough to accentuate their features, brown hair, and short stature. I remember being pinched for mentioning that last part, and that made me chuckle slightly as I drink another swig of my canned beer.

It was another day in the rowdy manga club room. 

Everyone is speaking over each other over the new release of the magazine, discrediting theories, putting up pages and pages of research of their new theories. One of the people particularly speaking out loud was this young boy, who I forgot the name of, but I remember that it starts with a Y. 

I was sitting right in the middle of the room, on a table with four chairs on it, usually left alone by others. The initials "ABG" is scratched in the middle of the table, along with a painting of a beautiful kaleidoscopic-haired girl next to it, pouting.

In other parts of the room, I can see a shrine made for a character that I know of, a blondie with star eyes, fighting against people about sibling or something.

Some people can be seen coloring panels in the back of the room, keeping discussion to themselves, but sometimes they can be seen looking at me with stinky eyes. This particular group of people doesn't like me drinking alcohol in the club room, messing up the vibe with my drunken antics, and vomit sometimes. They're not the only one, but they're the one openly hating me.

"You sure you can take another bottle of those, Al?" said one of the coloring people with disdain. There we go, a live example. I remember who that was, it was this man called Reso. "One of these days, that thing's gonna kill you."

"Oh yeah? Isn't that a good thing then?" I replied with a drunken laugh, and watched as his face went red before he was stopped by someone else. They went to the fridge and brought me another six cans of beer, and say, "Here you go, another six of these, I know you love them soooo much, right?"

I sat upright and looked at the person in the eyes. Someone with brown hair and short stature, but none of the familiar smile.

How I wish this person was the same person who would tease me to death. But no, instead, it was a pale imitation of them.

"Thanks for the help, Thorny."

"You're welcome, Ally."

My eyebrow twitches. "Very funny, I thought we're past this already. You do not call me that name, ever."

They sit at the table next to me. "You're going to need to accept me sooner or later, Al."

"Never." I stand up, trying to leave, but their slender hands stopped me. "Toge, let me go."

The shapeshifting wolf called Toge sighed, but they did not let go. "What would you do if I don't want to?" I turned around angrily, and saw them looking up to me defiantly, their hands tightly gripping to my arm.

I looked down, furious, and pulled them closer to meet my eyes. I don't answer their question, I just... stare at their black brown eyes. Eyes that I remember used to radiate so much warmth, so much kindness... now replaced by whatever this is. Defiance. Rebellious. Angry.

We keep looking at each other closely. My awareness is filled with them, and perhaps colored by memories of someone that ceased to be. The mix of them both managed to dim my senses, so much that I only realized minutes later that the room has ceased its noise, and the only sound I can hear is the sound of my breath, and the sound of their breath.
