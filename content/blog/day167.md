*Henjin no Salad Bowl* today delves into Livia and Sara kinda falling out over her "figurines" (jesus Noa, that's really creepy but like it's so well made still...), Livia meeting with her old homeless bro, and a bit about Brenda and Haruka figuring out that making chocolate is hard for a reason...

Started *Sentai Daishikkaku* today, and holy shit they cook with EVERYTHING so far (just the first four episode, since that's the one with the high quality fansubs). The visual gags, *crazy* animation, and I can finally say after hearing so many people raving about it... the OP is a fucking banger indeed. Can't believe we're getting the same guy for *Oshi no Ko* Season 2's OP too... we're gonna eat so good
