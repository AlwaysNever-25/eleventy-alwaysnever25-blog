Warning, this post is filled with me gushing(?) about a rap/hip-hop beef. If you don't give a shit about this, just skip this over. There's no need to subject yourself with hip hop drama stuff if you don't care about it.

da beef is going strong today, woke up to a BACK TO BACK release from Drake and Kendrick!

'family matters' is released as a music video, and Drake shot back by debunking a lot of things Kung Fu Kenny said to him, including showing the chains he get from Pharrell that he supposedly melted down (a lie), eating at the New Ho King place that Kendrick mocked him about, destroying the supposedly same van that was shown in "good kid, m.A.A.d city" deluxe edition cover, and wearing the supposedly same ring that Kendrick use to propose to his current partner.

The content of the diss ain't lacking either, alleging that he is a fake activist, and most importantly alleging that one of his child is actually someone else's, supposedly Dave Free, someone he know from childhood.

He also addressed others in this track, listen to them here.

I'd say this, if this was something people can ruminate properly for a day or even more than an hour, this was something good. Sadly, Drake didn't focus on Kendrick fully for this track, since he also addressed others, continuing the line he did on Push Ups where he also dissed others alongside Kendrick. That brings the diss track momentum down a bit, in my opinion, but... there's something else that drags the song down.

Just like the warning he gave in "Euphoria" and "6:16 in LA", Kendrick... really predicted his angles and have a mole in OVO.

This bastard really dropped a diss track not even an hour after 'familly matters' dropped, titled 'meet the grahams'

You know what's the cover for this diss track? It was a zoomed out image of the "6:16 in LA" cover, where we can see along with the gloves are bottle of ozempic pills and jewelry receipts, supposedly either for the chains or for the rings that Drake used on the 'family matters' music video. You can see the cover below, listen to it while you can.

'meet the grahams' does remind me of a lot of things. First, it reminds me of this trash talk skit that Key & Peele did, with Kendrick being Paulo Odbelis with his verses.

Second, it reminds me of this moment by Brennan Lee Mulligan as his emo character Evan Kelmp.

Anyway, for the lyrics though... JESUS CHRIST KENDRICK, you're actually playing your role as the boogeyman too well, the whole track was so fucking creepy and disrespectful. You start by addressing ADONIS?? NOT DRAKE??? And it fucking CONTINUES ON THE NEXT VERSE to HIS *PARENTS*?

I'm not even starting on the craziest thing yet, the third verse is addressing a HIDDEN DAUGHTER? YES, ANOTHER CHILDREN THAT DRAKE HID, LIKE ADONIS WASN'T ENOUGH- WHAT THE FUCK KDOT????????

Other than all that disrespect he's showing, following through "Euphoria", in this track he is bringing it further. Some of the shit he said just *dripped* with venom, one of the line is basically saying that Drake shouldn't have been born, and calling for him to *die*. It's *foul*, it's a real beef, I've heard diss tracks over the years before this. "Ether", "Takeover", "No Vaseline". Bruh, I even listen to a concurrent beef happening with this one, a diss track by *Chris Brown* ('Weakest Link', a diss to Quavo), and that shit is just as venomous, if not less, as this one.

Anyway, this stuff actually overwhelms me for the whole day, and the craziest thing is that I was planning to progress more on my anime watching and stuff today, because I didn't have class today. The whole day's worth of class is cancelled... I was so happy about that, but then... this shit happened. My ass is glued to the chair and I spent the whole day just listening to reactions and just... talking about it everywhere. It's crazy, this shit is crazy, I'm actually witnessing history right now. I can actually say I was there when people refer to a historical event in a hip hop context.
