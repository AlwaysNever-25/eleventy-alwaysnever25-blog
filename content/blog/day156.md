I'm stressing out over the website I've been making for the past few days that I need to present today... so I decided it would be a great idea for me to start a VN.

Yes, you heard me right. I'm STARTING a *Visual Novel*. Like, a brand new, unshilled by this VN nerd I'm friend with, *V I S U A L N O V E L*.

If you want to know the name, it's *Biniku no Kaori*. If you're wondering why I didn't make that into a link, I am imploring you to just search it on Google. You will understand why I don't really want to explain what this series is about.
