Nijisanji...

News about them have been coming in ever since the beginning of February, starting with the Selen dismissal.

The story got worse now, as we are getting response from Elira, Vox, and Ike. I haven't really watch the videos, and the follow up response by the Nijisanji CEO, but the whole thing burned even more ire from everyone.

You want to know why? Because the timing of the release was suspect. They released the video right as Dokibird (Selen's new name) started her first gaming stream playing Neopets, making her cut her stream short. Pettiness can be felt from that timing alone.

Second of all, the statements (from all the secondhand statement that I saw) were kinda weird. It mentions documents that were supposed to be only seen by lawyers of each side, but the documents were viewed by Elira, Vox, Ike. Not exactly lawyers themselves.

I'm just really taking it in from the sides, not really putting out statement impassionately saying that I'm boycotting NijiEN or something (I did put in that I am mad that this made me lose out on ever getting Pomu 3D back, at least), but it's pretty clear to me that after this, there is no going back for Nijisanji EN, and potentially Nijisanji as a whole. Well, at least the parent company is safer than the branch, I feel.

This just makes me sad for Pomu... Man...

Anyway, Look Back, a one-shot created by Tatsuki Fujimoto the GOAT (Chainsaw Man and Fire Punch mangaka), is going to have an anime movie. I'm excited to hear this news, for real.

Even though the movie will not be coming to Indonesia anytime soon, I'm holding out hope that it does... since I got to watch the *Bunny Girl Senpai*'s second movie last year.
