Finished *Roshidere* volume 1. It's quite good, but the translation is dog shit... wished there's a better translation out there, I'll probably reread the volume again with a better TL once I caught up or something. Maybe this would lead me to edit the *Roshidere* wiki, I saw that they're not as organized as they could be... ðŸ‘€

I'm feeling like my pit is no longer the same now as before. Before, it felt like I was free falling in a bottomless space, with no one to stop me, no one that would hold their hand to lift me up. But now... now it feels more like I'm drowning in a bottomless ocean... selfishly, obsessively, possessively trying to carry everything I cared about on my back, but slowly losing strength and getting carried deep into the ocean... at times, I would succeed in surfacing, and breathe a fresh air, but my body took the beating for me to do that, and the damage keeps accumulating...

I'm genuinely scared of what my body would be like when I'm old. I don't want to think about it...
