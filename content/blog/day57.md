I was still staying over at the cool peeps' apartment.

Today, after I pointed out to them about a weather report saying that Wednesday might be raining, we have a schedule change.

Wednesday was supposed to be a day where we go to the amusement park, but we moved it to today instead, because the forecast was that today is sunny, or at least low chance of raining.

And so we go to the northern part of the city, to experience some fun.

I don't really have good memories of this place, but it's kinda surprising to realize that when you're coming here with people you enjoy instead of people you have to be with... it's a lot more fun.

I went to all the attraction that my old self would probably hate going to, not even thinking about it. Now, I can open my eyes and... have a big laugh about it. It's so fun... I wish I can hang out like this with them forever...
