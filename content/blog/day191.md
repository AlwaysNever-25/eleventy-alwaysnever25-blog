Thinking about something...

(Note from future Al: I have no goddamn idea what past Al is thinking about. Like, goddamn, if you have something you think about, just put it in writing instead of writing this vague ass shit and make me confused about it.)

*Spy x Family Season 2* Cruise arc ends with episode 8 and 9, and honestly it's been really fun watch for me. The last two episode though, especially that moment where Yor fights against all those assassins with the backdrop of firework... it's peak. It's just... so peak.
