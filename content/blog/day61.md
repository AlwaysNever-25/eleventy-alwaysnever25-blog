Today I have no class, which means... time to laze around- NOT. Turns out, my maid picked this exact day to go back home, so for a bit, the chore around the house are going to be shared between the family, and that includes me.

Okay, the chores aren't that much, so I did still end up lazing around... I picked this time to start progressing on my Contracts, specifically playing more Darkest Dungeon, trying The Letter, and finally progressing a ton in my Tomb Raider (2013) playthrough.

I also finalized my plans for the month of March, the final month before my Contract season ended. This is the plan for this month:

## March 1-7 
* Finish Tomb Raider (2013)/Rise of the Tomb Raider. 
* Finish Magus of the Library.
* Finish Your Throne (at least the minimum 60 chapters)
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon (at least getting one L6 char).
* Finish Tomb Raider Review (optional). 
* Progress through/finish NNB Repeat (optional).

## March 8-14 
* Finish The Letter. 
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon (at least finishing the FIRST Darkest Dungeon quest, or better). 
* Finish The Letter Review (optional).
* Finish Magus of the Library Review.
* Finish Your Throne Review.
* Progress through/finish NNB Repeat. 
* Progress through NNB Nonstop (optional, only if you have finished NNB repeat).

## March 15-21
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon (at least finishing the second and/or third Darkest Dungeon quest, or better). 
* Finish the reviews of the two games if not done yet (mandatory). 
* Finish the reviews of the two series if not done yet (mandatory).
* Progress through/finish NNB Nonstop. 
* Progress through NNB full review (optional, only start if you finished NNB Nonstop early).

## March 22-28
* FINISH Darkest Dungeon (final quest done).
* FINISH NNB review.
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon Review.

## March 29 - April 3
* FINISH Darkest Dungeon Review.
* FINISH everything else you didn't finish in earlier weeks. (Hard Deadline.)

Dear God... please help me get through this month.

And I also finished... volume 14 of *Imouto Sae Ireba Ii*, finishing my journey through the series at last. The volume (which I feel like counts as an epilogue of sorts after the climax of last volume) managed to get in one last degeneracy, one last climax, and one last
