Today I have no class, which means... time to laze around- NOT. Turns out, my maid picked this exact day to go back home, so for a bit, the chore around the house are going to be shared between the family, and that includes me.

Okay, the chores aren't that much, so I did still end up lazing around... I picked this time to start progressing on my Contracts, specifically playing more Darkest Dungeon, trying The Letter, and finally progressing a ton in my Tomb Raider (2013) playthrough.

I also finalized my plans for the month of March, the final month before my Contract season ended. This is the plan for this month:

## March 1-7 
* Finish Tomb Raider (2013)/Rise of the Tomb Raider. 
* Finish Magus of the Library.
* Finish Your Throne (at least the minimum 60 chapters)
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon (at least getting one L6 char).
* Finish Tomb Raider Review (optional). 
* Progress through/finish NNB Repeat (optional).

## March 8-14 
* Finish The Letter. 
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon (at least finishing the FIRST Darkest Dungeon quest, or better). 
* Finish The Letter Review (optional).
* Finish Magus of the Library Review.
* Finish Your Throne Review.
* Progress through/finish NNB Repeat. 
* Progress through NNB Nonstop (optional, only if you have finished NNB repeat).

## March 15-21
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon (at least finishing the second and/or third Darkest Dungeon quest, or better). 
* Finish the reviews of the two games if not done yet (mandatory). 
* Finish the reviews of the two series if not done yet (mandatory).
* Progress through/finish NNB Nonstop. 
* Progress through NNB full review (optional, only start if you finished NNB Nonstop early).

## March 22-28
* FINISH Darkest Dungeon (final quest done).
* FINISH NNB review.
* Progress through Darkest Dungeon Review.

## March 29 - April 3
* FINISH Darkest Dungeon Review.
* FINISH everything else you didn't finish in earlier weeks. (Hard Deadline.)

Dear God... please help me get through this month.

And I also finished... volume 14 of *Imouto Sae Ireba Ii*, finishing my journey through the series at last. The volume (which I feel like counts as an epilogue of sorts after the climax of last volume) managed to get in one last degeneracy, one last climax, and one last cool moment from our protagonist.

*"Bring it on!"*

It's peak... I don't know what else to say. Everyone is more grown up now, the story seems more mature but also didn't lose it's roots of being degenerate, people who we know earlier as a younger person have changed significantly.

I am planning to write a thorough review on what I feel on the volume in my anilist review, so when that happens I'll just copy and paste the thing below here. Things that I might not put in in that review though... is that I'm now working on the Imosae wiki!

You know a series is good when I started working on their wiki... or maybe it's just because the wiki is pretty much filled with nothing and I wanted to work on it, heh.
