Tonight, just before I slept, I forgot to save for the progress of my secret santa gift. I almost lost all will of doing anything after I found out that the whole work are not saved at all, and unlike Word, Premiere does NOT have autosave. All those progress... I have to face the music at that point, and decided to scrap some of the ideas I have in favor of a completely new one, just a full MV instead of MV with embellishment.

Other than that, I don't have anything to do today, so I opt to rest and such. I continued my work on the *Mato Seihei no Slave* wiki, and finally returned to *Zom 100* wiki. My plans for *Zom 100* was actually to improve on the wiki when the anime is airing, potentially adding more interested party towards the wiki, but the constant delays made me realize that the plans are not feasible, and the interest are waning already towards the series, and consequently, towards the wiki itself, so even *I* stopped editing after a bit.

But now I'm back, and I'm thinking of changing a lot of things here. Revamping characters, adding chapter images, messing with the templates, and updating the last three episodes of the anime (aired as one during Christmas last year).

I'm also working on my secret santa gift, left abandoned for almost a month now. Worked with the music, and now integrating it to a video. It's fun and also scary to make this video, since I don't know much about how to edit video, and I'm basically winging it at this point. Hopefully it doesn't show.

While I do all those, I listened to some K-Pop music that I've left behind for a bit, like Aespa's "Drama", Dreamcatcher's "OOTD", and EVERGLOW's "Slay". It's like I never left.

I also listened to Honkai Star Rail's 2.0 Trailer, with the song "White Night" today. That was a bop as well, I can't wait to go to Penacony.
