Problems have a funny way of presenting itself. Creeping behind you, lurking, unnoticed, until it's too late for you to address it.

In a way, that's life, but in another way, it sucks that it has to be this way. I know this will sound naive, and completely goes against the message of this movie I just watched, *Dune Part Two*, but I wished I have Paul's prescience, just so I can at least see a problem creeping up my way.

And not end up wondering about the good times like [Andy Bernard did in *The Office* (US)](https://youtu.be/0Gvk0_6p_-s?t=15).

Well, let's just say that this wasn't the first time I have to scream while riding my bike, out of anguish. I screamed a lot riding my bike, for pleasure, for relief. For anguish? I've done that too. This day... just another one added to the pile, I guess.

Oh, and yeah. If you missed it above... I watched *Dune Part Two*. On IMAX! Worth my time and money. Really wished I can do it in a better circumstances, though. Not much I can say that wouldn't make me sound like a wannabe YouTube reviewer, though. I'm not someone who read the book first for this movie, nor am I someone deep entrenched in Star Wars lore to ever compare this. The one I can say is, there is no way I'll ever able to experience what I feel in IMAX by watching it alone with my headphone. The theater is packed, like, really packed, and it was Monday! (Provided, we're all having a collective day off today... and no, not because Dune happened. Ramadan is coming.)

Sadly, having a theater that packed means I have to pick a late time for the viewing... I was planning to go bookshopping as well after watching... didn't happen, of course.
