So... another exam today. This feels less bad than the previous two exam, because I feel like I filled in everything to my power in this one. I managed to do it in time, too. There are no lingering feeling behind for this course, so I'm just hoping what I have put in is correct and I got a passing grade. I'm not aiming for the greatest.

I find myself reading... multiple short romance mangas. I don't know why... I just want to read them suddenly. The series are:
+ *Fundari, Kettari, Aishitari*
+ *Kanojo ni Uwaki Sareteita Ore ga, Koakuma na Kouhai ni Natsukareteimasu*
+ *Hayama Sensei to Terano Sensei wa Tsukiatteiru*
+ *Kanojo ga Senpai ni NTR-reta node, Senpai no Kanojo wo NTR-masu*
+ *Ano Hanagasaku Oka de, Kun to Mata Deaetara*

Okay starting from the top. *Fundari, Kettari, Aishitari* is a Josei manga about a office worker lady and a playboy ikemen who connected as they hung out in a clandestine bar, and their slow and gradual build up of realizing each other feeling after they both drunkenly has a one night stand. It was... honestly a bit more aggressive than the enemies-to-lover stories I used to read, and the guy is just really invading personal space like that, I was like... wow, this is what they mean when they say that being pretty could let you off the hook for anything. It's slowly being scanlated now, but the current chapter is currently where they both are getting more comfortable with each other, which was really fun to read. The chapters until that part was a bit hard to go through, but it was not that bad that I'll drop it. 7/10 for now.

The next one is *Kanojo ni Uwaki Sareteita Ore ga, Koakuma na Kouhai ni Natsukareteimasu*. Honestly, this series is just like any other romance to me, but this time the main girl is a Kouhai character, Shinohara. (I'm not a romance extraordinaire here, but I don't find that often. Usually they're like the third girl after the main girl and the MC's childhood friend). The other girls in the series are Ayaka, the MC's old friend (not childhood) who has a past with Shinohara, and the MC's ex-girlfriend, who cheated on him (purportedly, as she seems to have something that she keeps to herself). Honestly, Ayaka is a top tier character... the manga does not have the best art. If I, a goddamn newbie at reading manga, can realize that some of the art looks totally off, I bet those who reads more than me can see how bad it is. The recent chapters been a lot, lot better though, and I enjoy how social every single person seems to be, even the MC. At least he's not claiming that he's a loner or something, and he also plays basketball without being a jock. Truly, an everyman MC, ~~hate~~love to see it!

The other three are still ongoing read. *Hayama Sensei to Terano Sensei wa Tsukiatteiru* is a cute Yuri about teachers dating each other (and have sex!). *Kanojo ga Senpai ni NTR-reta node, Senpai no Kanojo wo NTR-masu* is a story about how the MC got NTR'd by his senpai, so he decided to NTR him back by screwing his girlfriend (that he knows personally). Honestly, this kind of story is my guilty pleasure, so... it doesn't matter if the premise sounds bad, I will be there no matter what. *Ano Hanagasaku Oka de, Kun to Mata Deaetara* is a story about a JK (high school girl) who time travelled to the era of World War II, and presumably find love with one of the soldiers. I'm expecting them to really explore the effects of that war, since this series seems highly rated in Japan, so much that they made a Live-Action movie out of it? I'm reading this in Indonesian, because there are no English Translation available so far...

That's all for my report on these series today. Also... *Yofukashi no Uta* ended in their 200th chapter. It was a whelming ending, for sure, but it was nice to see Kou as a High School Detective Apprentice. I do demand AN EPILOGUE FOR THIS, *Scum's Wish Decor* STYLE! DO IT!

I should really go back to studying...
