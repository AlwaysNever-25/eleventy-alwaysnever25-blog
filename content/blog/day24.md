So... another exam today. This feels less bad than the previous two exam, because I feel like I filled in everything to my power in this one. I managed to do it in time, too. There are no lingering feeling behind for this course, so I'm just hoping what I have put in is correct and I got a passing grade. I'm not aiming for the greatest.
