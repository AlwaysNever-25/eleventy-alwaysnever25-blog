Planned to spend all night after yesterday's events to see how far I can get in *Darkest Dungeon*. I kinda fell asleep before I can do that.

In the end, I was able to only get people to level 6 instead of challenging the Darkest Dungeon. I haven't built enough peeps to even try and get the FIRST Darkest Dungeon.

It's over for me...

In another news, that means I'm free for the next few months to actually finish all these stuff I have in my Planned to watch/read lists! I binged my way through *Dangers In My Heart* Season 2, that I stopped at the middle because I was too busy. I should be able to finish it tomorrow, then I'll move on to *100 Kanojo*...

And yeah, Anna and Kyotaro remains to be the cutest couple (they're both adorable weirdos I love them so much).

I hate this event so much. Why am I even back in Arknights...
