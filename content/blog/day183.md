First final exam today. Did pretty well, at least, to my knowledge. Not gonna be surprised if the score is going to be mid though...

Today though I spent some time playing Wuthering Waves, exploring and stuff, but also... the bad news is that my dad is going to bunk with me for the next week, at least.

That means no *Biniku no Kaori* reading in regular night time... so I tried to hasten the progress by reading them today, before my dad has to sleep in my room (or enter my room for any reason, the chances for that is higher now that he sleeps here).

I managed to progress far enough in the story, but this is still one of the two longer routes... I'm not even finished yet here... I'll have to do a double time if I want to start *Atri -My Dear Moments-* before the anime airs at least.

Oh, and I also bought Celeste and West of Loathing (and the DLC Reckonin' in Gun Manor). I'm contemplating buying something else, another Visual Novel, but I think I'll stop for now. Until next steam sale...
