We continued our *Sentai Daishikkaku* journey today, as we finally delve in to the shonen part of the series, in my opinion. The subs are back to normal level of quality, but the gags and the animation still holds up, even though I'd say there are some weakness that are very visible in the animation. Anyway though, we get to see Angel and Hisui! Two of my favorite character from this series... yeah, I said it, I know what's gonna happen in the future :')
