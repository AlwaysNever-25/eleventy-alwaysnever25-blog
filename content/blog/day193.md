I watched a movie called *When Evil Lurks* (2023) today. Just on a whim, after I was invited by an unexpected person.

I don't really like it.

Here's the only screenshot I have for this movie, I think I took it by mistake or something:

I will say, the movie itself is very well made, but the writing on some of the characters are... not the best, I'd say. If the intention is to convey how being in panic can make you do some very dumb stuff, then sure... and of course, the villain of this story is also very manipulative so it's pretty much in line with the intention, but at some point I get to look at the screen and just scream at the actions some characters took...

Also extra tidbit, here's me and the person who invited me, scared af:

Also another fun fact, I have to watch this movie whilst being on call with another friend of mine. Having to watch it in some kind of multitasking way does help since I don't want to focus 100% on getting jumpscared, but it might've soured me on the experience as a whole.

*Gimai Seikatsu* episode continues to maintain this kind of arthouse vibe (a term I just found after reading the reddit comment about this series), with each interaction between the sibling carefully crafted to portray them finding out more and more about each other's values, but this episode ends with this weird fast forwarded scene after Saki almost got hurt trying to cross the road with her earphone on. 

I need to know what happened, because the way it goes I thought that this series just imply that all of this doesn't actually happen and the crash is the catalyst of it all... or it's just a very stylistic way to depict a traumatic experience, I have no idea. Give me the next episode, please....
