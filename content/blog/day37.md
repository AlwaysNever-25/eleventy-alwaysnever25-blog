Today we have our first Laboratory class, and it was honestly just HTML and CSS, which I already kinda learn whilst trying to build my github pages... they do delve into semantics HTML as well, but other than that, it's not noteworthy.

Before that Laboratory class though, we have our lecture class about the same course. Through prior agreement I managed to get myself a group with four girls. We already agreed on this composition since last semester, and I already talked about it with the boys as well. For this particular course, I'll be helping them actively since this is something that I've been learning for the past couple of month, just for my own knowledge.

Speaking of the Laboratory class again... I'm kinda ashamed to say that for the first hour of it, my mind was not really into the class, since I have my play-in round for the AMQ tournament by then. I had to borrow my friend's bluetooth earphone and used my phone's tethering hotspot so that I can have a stable connection for the match. The match went really smoothly for me, only because the format is multiple choice instead of typing. 

I didn't pay enough attention on the rules and didn't notice how the first round has that as a format, and I've been studying and training with the assumption that I'm going to do typing, which is EXTREMELY harder in comparison. Turns out in my bracket I can basically choose between multiple choice or typing, but for the first play-in round, you have to do it through multiple choice.

I was still sweating a bit as we play though, but I managed to clinch the first round, and the second round went even smoother. It was a big relief for me, because at least I didn't go down in the first round, but the next round I am facing one of the higher seeded people. It's also someone that I interacted a bit on Discord. I will give him the respect he deserves, and study some more.
