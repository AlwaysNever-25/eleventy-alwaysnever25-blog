Class is back as of today... is what should have happened, but turns out class is cancelled. 

Not all the class are cancelled though, I still need to go there... for like an hour length class where we're doing basically nothing and it becomes a glorified attempt of taking attendance. Sigh.

Anyway, I did finish *Mato* yesterday, which means I am now going to continue my journey with *Chainsaw Man*. Goddamn Kobeni is so pathetic... the VA really sold her character well.

Also, an update to the list I made back in [day 106](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day106/):

- Wiki/College
- ~~Darkest Dungeon (trying to finish it)~~ not gonna bother finishing it
- ~~Solo Leveling~~
- ~~100 Kanojo~~/~~Mato Seihei no Slave~~/Chainsaw Man/~~Dress Up Darling~~ (wheel choice)
- Seasonals (Henjin no Salad Bowl, Sasakoi, Spice and Wolf, Ranger Reject)
- Grace's Charlotte groupwatch/Nut's Imosae groupwatch
- non priority anime list (NNB: Repeat, SpyxFam S2, My Happy Marriage, takt op.Destiny, Summer Time Render) w/ wheel choice
- Fata Morgana: Requiem/Cyanotype Daydream
anything below this list is a floating priority (can be done whenever I'm free and unable to do any of the things above)
- LNs (Roshidere, Eminence, Aobuta, Higehiro, Re:Zero)
- Re:Solution mangas (Oyasumi Punpun, Kubo, Happy Sugar Life, Rengoku no Toshi, Zai x 10, Shoujo Junrei, Ane no Shinyuu, Watashi no Koibito.)
- Re:Solution animes (Dead Mount Death Play Part 2, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, Belle, NNB: Nonstop)
- Brandosando books (sorry Mr. Sanderson...)
this is reserved to things I need to finish in the future, potentially after everything above (except Brandosando books) are done for my own sanity
- Manga PTRs (too much to list)
- The World After The Fall
- Higurashi
- Umineko (VN)
- Fate/stay night (VN) -> Fate/stay night: UBW & Heaven's Feel film trilogy -> Tsukihime
- some TV shows (Fallout, Severance, His Dark Materials, or new Cobra Kai seasons or whatever)

I've added some new stuff, including the animanga that I put in for my Re:Solution event in AniList! I'm moving ahead slowly with the list while I take a break from contract (willingly and also because I'm penalized lmao). You can call this my training arc...
