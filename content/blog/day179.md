*Biniku no Kaori*... reached a point that I know will happen as I go through the bad endings, but still... it gets my knees weak knowing what I'm going to read. Thankfully it was short, otherwise I'll have to really skip the story there...

I also unlocked a certain game feature that allows me to see the... animated... CG. Yeah, if you know anything about VN, you know what I mean. Well, I was expecting a lot more than just animated CG, like a specific place to get ALL CG, if possible, but I'm thinking it might get opened as I go through the route...

And I also get a Good End too today! Overall, it's 11/18 ending, with 10 bad endings and 1 good ending. The last seven endings are going to be longer, though, looking at the guides.

Wish me luck that I can survive this game, or at least finish this before my dad bunks in with me while my parents room are getting repainted, cause they'll probably stay for a week or so... I have to delay the game that long if I don't finish them quickly.

We get to see a new character, Taoqi, one of the department of defense (not the actual name but it might as well be that) leader. She reminds me of Himemori Luna from Hololive...
