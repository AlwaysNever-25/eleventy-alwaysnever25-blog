Starting to notice that I am getting easily miffed by a lot of things... or maybe this is just me finally realizing that I have less ego than everyone else and that results with me getting dunked on, used, and manipulated and it pisses me off.

Or I'm just tired. That's probably it.

Anyway, I had to talk about the game since I can FINALLY play it without interruption (well, a little bit of interruption here and there).

First of all, graphics-wise this game is *beautiful*. I didn't manage to take much screenshot of the early game, but the cutscenes were just *insane*.

Graphics wise, this game is pretty good. It's not the best, but during cutscenes I honestly cannot tell when did they switch into a gameplay-like cutscenes (this is pretty much a big flaw from HSR, I don't really remember if Genshin has similar issues with this or not) and some kind of directed cutscenes, because holy shit the angles they use is pretty much like I'm playing a Triple-A games. With the graphic, it really does feel LIKE a Triple-A game... even down to the issue people have which happens to Triple-A games release too.

Now we move to gameplay. Honestly, it's pretty rad, but it does rely more on my motor skill... which means if I die, that's literally skill issue from me. Thankfully though, it seems like I've been playing it very careful, since I haven't died once since I played the game. Or perhaps I've been overleveling my characters... The dodge mechanic, parry, and the combos were all pretty fun to learn, challenging, but not frustrating. I wish I can actually understand them thoroughly, but I have time. This game should last for a while, hopefully, crossing my fingers.

Movement in this game is snappy, but still feel kinda awkward. The jump is very stiff if you compare it to Genshin, where it feels kinda natural. The only thing I'll give them props for is that you can wallrun, which looks so cool, and faster than walljump that Genshin has. (I'm sorry that I'm comparing it to Genshin, but this IS supposed to be a Genshin competitor).

The story so far is not as bad as people are making it online as well. I was invested, even before Scar appeared, but I guess I'll say there are props in people saying it's not as great as it could be. The EN dubs are HORRIBLE though, which was the sentiment that you would usually find when you compare dubs and subs, but recently there's been influx of quality coming through EN dubs. Regretfully, this game does not have them, yet. I've heard great things about future characters, so I'll be waiting patiently for them to appear and check. (Or checking on YouTube, perhaps)

Also, I rolled two great characters from the *very first ten-pull*, but they both happened to be... *sigh*

With all the gifts we'll be getting due to the hotfixes they have to pump out (unoptimized stuff causing issues in lower end hardwares and random high end hardwares too), I should be able to get pretty much every 5-star Standard Character, except Lingyang (I do not mind). I'm planning to get Jianxin from the beginner selector banner, which will be faster to finish now that I get the discounted banner really early... and I'm planning to get Calcharo from the new voucher we will be getting. Calcharo in particular will be really good with Yinlin, a character I'm planning to pull, and they're both electro (my favorite element in general, even on Genshin I like them).

Anyway, here's a last Sanhua smile to brighten your day. (why is this woman a 4-star????)
