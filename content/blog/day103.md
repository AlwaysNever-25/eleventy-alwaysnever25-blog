Caught up with *Roshidere* manga adaptation as well... the manga adapted right until the part that I read on this MTL LN translation that I got... holy shit Yuki is even more precious in this one I love her so much

-----

I went ahead and pre-ordered Indonesian version of *Roshidere* LN... it comes with some extra stuff... I want it... this is all because my cousin told me about this during our Eid Al-Fitr gathering... he's a very persuasive person. Okay, it doesn't help that I got money from my aunts during that gathering too.

I also bought something else, hopefully I can use it for the review, if it come soon enough...

-----

I lost a whole party to Wilbur today, in *Darkest Dungeon*... that one hurts, cause I got a crazy setup with my leper but I did not get lucky with deathblows... they all just dies during the first death blow resist roll, the fuck...

Well, at least I got the achievement of party wipe I guess... and dying to Wilbur... and party wipe at the boss too...
