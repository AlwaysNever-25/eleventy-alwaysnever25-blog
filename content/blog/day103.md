Caught up with *Roshidere* manga adaptation as well... the manga adapted right until the part that I read on this MTL LN translation that I got... holy shit Yuki is even more precious in this one I love her so much-

-----

Thinking about making that story I thought up about when I was a kid, about a civilization of mouse/rats. Definitely inspired by a lot of things, like *MouseHunt* (not the movie, the facebook game. you heard me right), and somehow inspired because I was playing Sims at the time and have to come up with fictional title for a book series (I made my Sim become a writer as a job).

Anyway, if I remember correctly, the title I had in mind for the series are as follows:

- Mouse Dynasty
- Mouse Tyranny: Uprising
- Mouse Tyranny: Downfall
- Mouse Irony
- Mouse Memory

Anyway, the story came up to the forefront of my mind again because of this [tweet](https://twitter.com/creepydotorg/status/1778471751430615506) about the "Universe 25" experiment... I'm thinking of exploring this topic and see if I can incorporate it to the story...

I went ahead and pre-ordered Indonesian version of *Roshidere* LN... it comes with some extra stuff... I want it... this is all because my cousin told me about this during our Eid Al-Fitr gathering... he's a very persuasive person. Okay, it doesn't help that I got money from my aunts during that gathering too.

I also bought something else, hopefully I can use it for the review, if it come soon enough...

I lost a whole party to Wilbur today, in *Darkest Dungeon*... that one hurts, cause I got a crazy setup with my leper but I did not get lucky with deathblows... they all just dies during the first death blow resist roll, the fuck...

Well, at least I got the achievement of party wipe I guess... and dying to Wilbur... and party wipe at the boss too...
