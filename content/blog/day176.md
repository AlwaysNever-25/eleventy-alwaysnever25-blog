Spent the day feeling a bit hyper, and made a NIKKE Tier list with my friend. Yeah... a NIKKE tier list, you heard that right.

Other than that, I found new series to read, like *Imasara desu ga, Osananajimi wo Suki ni Natte Shimaimashita*, a series where the author wrote a webnovel chapter, and then release it, alongside a webmanga chapter drawn by our goat YOM (Douki-chan author). It's a novel concept I don't think *I've* seen before, so I'll be watching the update with interest.

Also the girl is kinda cute, bringing back the tsundere vibes that has been lacking so far during my journey.

I also started Spy x Family Season 2, ignoring the wheel decision I have for NNB: Repeat and probably might move it down, cause I want to LMAO. The start of Season 2 is pretty funny, I think I might binge them all in rapid succession, especially after it reaches the Cruise arc, but for now I only watched one episode...

I did tell you I was a bit hyper today.
