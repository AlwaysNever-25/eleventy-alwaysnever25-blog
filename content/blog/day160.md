Today is one of the busiest day I have ever lived through.

I wake up at 5:45 AM today, to get a Hotel breakfast, since my friend is staying over at a hotel with his visiting parents, and his parents has left for the airport early in the morning. He then asks if I want to get some breakfast with him before he has to check out of the room. Knowing Hotel breakfast and how tasty they are, I couldn't refuse.

And so we had breakfast, and kinda skipped the first session of the class (we're tired after eating breakfast).

Then class happens, kinda boring, not gonna talk about it.

After that, I got home at 3 PM, and rested for 1.5 hours. I was really tired.

Then my sister wake me up so that we can go to our cousin's birthday. This is one of the rare moment where me and my sister goes together in a car. I remember feeling more and more like I'm an adult as I do this, since this is unthinkable when I'm a teenager. Going together without my dad behind the wheels? It's just... unthinkable.

We got back home just before 10 PM.

And now I have to rest really early, because tomorrow I have yet another event.

I just want to play some games man...
