Made another comment for another friend's playlist in the Music Contract:

<details>
<summary><b>I really don't know what sort of music I like</b></summary>

**Contractor:** xxxxxxxxx
**Fav Track:** *i'm free*<br>
**Least Fav Track:** *Home*<br>

- **2 + 2 = 5:** *The guitar only sounding at my right ear and the percussion at my left ear in the beginning is so trippy... I love it! The moment it melded into both of my ears are also satisfying* 4/5
- **Life:** *Listening to this is like watching a horror movie where skeletons are coming for you but actually they're just dancers and singers in their previous life and now they're teaching you both how to dance and to sing. I can't help but bop to this. Saxophone solo also bangs* 4/5
- **i'm free:** *Heist movie, James Bond, I can't not vibe to this, what the fuck, this is too good, especially the part before the bridge I think? the melody reminds me of a song I used to hear a lot years ago, and I just love it...* :sob: ** 5/5
- **Summon The Fire:** *Bass(?) and Saxophone beat over drums and electronic sounds as the video displaying abstract display of what people are possibly dreaming when they're high... no lyrics needed, at some point I thought there was lyrics when there isn't, this is just a trip all the way through* 4/5
- **Home:** *This is a chill song that doesn't aim to be something you actively listen (or at least that's what I think), and so I don't have much opinion on it, it's not a bad song or anything but I had to relisten to it twice to find the right words to describe what I feeling for it, and you might say that means this song is replayable, but I am pretty much indifferent about it. The sax solo(?) part is great though* 3/5
- **Boreal Forest:** *Very easy listening, the type of music I can listen to in the background as I work or study, and it's very calming.... at least that's what I thought, until it starts ramping up, perhaps I'll put this music as I try to finish my assignment so that I can feel energized and hurried over as it starts to ramp up... great music, and great sax! Some sax part that I feel were familiar... until I realized it's reminiscent of Stranger Things Title Sequence theme, which I also enjoy* 4/5
- **Spend a Lifetime:** *The strings (like seriously, the strings) are really good, and the chill vocal along with the piano accompanies them well, but this has the same problem as "Home" above, and I do have to relisten to it to find my bearings and I'd say that means I'm indifferent about it* 3/5
- **Disco Ulysses:** *The bass got me to bop my head, and kinda overpowering other sounds lmao, if the bass is taken out this song wouldn't be as interesting* 3/5
- **BIBBIDIBA:** *I already have this on repeat before listening to this playlist so I'm hella biased, but it's such a bop, I don't care if her title is just gibberish nonsense (this and wii-wii-woo), I will always welcome them whenever I'm on some music binge... anyway, anyone else felt like punching the director in the MV too? no? just me? okay...* 5/5
- **Birth4000:** *is this Darude - Sandstorm's older, groovier brother? No, I'm not saying that as a comparison, but I can't help but think of it as I listen to this music. This bangs as well though, and each bubble pops just look satisying in the video lol. I do wish the latter part of the song are less repeated but I can't ask much from an EDM song I think* 4/5
- **In Person:** *Got the weirdest Bo Burnham vibes in the beginning there, but as it goes on, the vibes are getting more like indie music, and the ending is a zany electronic sound that almost sounded like if android farts there (not in a bad way), I enjoyed it but probably not going to replay* 3/5
- **Wide Open:** *This video made me realize I don't have trypophobia, and the song is chill until the middle right until the end where it gets funky slightly, but I don't think I have any strong opinions on it. The vocals and the funky electronic sounds are good though* 3/5

**Overall Thoughts:** I can confidently say some of these records belongs in the genre Jazz, with some on Electronics and stuff, so there you go, that's probably what type of music you liked XD anyway, these tracks are great, with the focus on sax, which I enjoy, thanks for recommending me these!
**Final Score:** **44/60**

I decided that waiting to read my PTRs are bullshit, so I'll start reading the first few chapters of some of my PTRs listed below:

- Akane-banashi
- Akarui Kioku Soushitsu
- Arasa Dakedo, Hatsukoi desu.
- Arte
- Ballroom e Youkoso
- Batsu Hare
- Binetsu Kuukan
- Blue Period
- Chi no Wadachi
- Dosanka Gal wa Namara Menkoi

This is only 10 mangas I picked from my PTRs, there's still more in that pile... anyway, my goal is to read this today, or in the next two days!

<details>
<summary>
Starting with <b>Akane-banashi</b>:
</summary>

I want to read this up to the tenth chapter, (only ended up reading up to the third chapter), the art so far is good, the plot and the use of Rakugo is intriguing (even if I think some things are not properly translated, I believe they're heading towards a good direction here with the translation), and Akane is so funny XD she's like Luffy if he doesn't talk about meat every time but instead talks about Rakugo
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>
Continuing with <b>Akarui Kioku Soushitsu</b>:
</summary>

I had to go more than three chapters for this one cause it's a 4-koma apparently (yikes), five chapters of this and it's just pure fluff about a girl who has amnesia (Arisa) and forget about everything including her girlfriend, the welder Mari-san, and her attempts to remember everything. It's more comedic than dramatic though, so I just found myself smiling whilst reading this. I also want to read this to the finish... but I digress
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>
And then we have <b>Arasa Dakedo, Hatsukoi desu.</b>:
</summary>

This is also a short manga (10 pages per chapter type of manga), so I have to extend it to five chapters as well to make it fair. The story is about a 28 year old girl Yamamoto-san who confessed that she never dated anyone before to her 32 year old boyfriend, Ueno-san but it turns out the boyfriend also has no experience before this as well! the art is really lovely, I especially love Yamamoto panicky face, the type of panicking face you can see in an anime where their eyes just goes into this white circle... there's also Kurata, their mutual friends who matchmake them, and she is also really cute (reminds me of Kansai from *Chikan Otoko* in a way)

I have to say, for this manga, I really do want to continue reading cause it's so fluffy... but I gotta be strong and continue reading everything else. This manga will probably be the first one on this PTR list that I finish though, since it's short, finished, and fluffy all the way.
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>
We have <b>Arte</b> next:
</summary>

This one is more like a classic mainstream manga with 50 pages first chapter and 30 pages for the subsequent chapter, so I will be reviewing the first three chapters. The story follows Arte, a princess in the Reinassance era who wants to be a painter. To tell you more of the story is to make a summary, so I'll just continue with my feelings about the series so far. The art is gorgeous, as it is touted to be when my friend recommended me this manga. Arte reminds me of Akane, and the story progression is a bit similar as the girls both prove themselves to be capable. Arte, however, comes off stronger because of the plot differences and the period this takes on. I also do learn a lot about the process of painting from these short three chapters, so any manga that can educate me on topics I don't know about previously is a welcome. Arte is a strong character, and I wish to read more than three chapters too for this one.

I was going to continue reading, but then I realized when I look at my Mihon dump that I have some backlog of *Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi*... so I decided to read it. It was... short, as usual, but the progress was honestly TOO QUICK. Like... what do you mean they're engaged now? Where's the kiss? Where's the pages where you buy the ring, or at least present it? Why does it timeskip to probably YEARS later? What???

Anyway, back to the PTR grind...

<details>
<summary>
We continued with <b>Ballroom e Youkoso</b>
</summary>

If dance is a sport- okay, it's not an *IF*, Dance IS a sport, and this manga portrays it as elegantly as it should, and also portrays the intensity that these competition brings, the ego that these dancers has, it's insane.... their glares are so intense that I want to look away from him, but I just keep reading away. for this manga, they seem to be monthly because the three chap I read is about the size of the first volume, so the progression is... very quick, like... too quick, at times. Sadly, this means that this manga is not something I want to consume rapidly, because of the long chapter page, but I would like to continue them when I have time, that's for sure
</details>

And now another intermission as I watch the next episode of *Oshi no Ko Season 2*, the episode where Abiko and Yoriko got into the most entertaining, sad, but also heartwarming argument. Ahh... they really adapted it well. They even adapted Akane's CHOKERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzsekfhzkfbdfbsjerghbrbgjderxbg-

(Future Al if you read this, screenshot Akane wearing a choker and post it here)

We do not talk about the *Oshi no Ko* chapter that was released on the same day.

<details>
<summary>
The last series for the day is <b>Batsu Hare</b>:
</summary>

This is some peak trash, I love it, the only reason why I'm not binging this to the finish is because this is not finished, and it's still ongoing... the plot is something I cannot describe to you, cause I'll probably combust just trying to explain it, and I'd rather not do that- yeah, this manga has some NTR, sure, you can have that at least
