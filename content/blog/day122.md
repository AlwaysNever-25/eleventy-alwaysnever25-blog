*Charlotte* groupwatch is also brought forward cause I'm not sure I can start it later this week because of how busy I'll be. So... the story is about high schooler getting powers, not something that I don't already see before, but I'm not in the stage where this would turn me off. The MC though, well, they definitely nailed a character that's going to need some development, for sure. From the two episodes I get to watch, it's pretty fun so far.
