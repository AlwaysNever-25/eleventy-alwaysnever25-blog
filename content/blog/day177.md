I read a webnovel called *The Best Friend of the Person I Like is Secretly Approaching Me*... don't ask me why I'm reading this and enjoying it.

-----

Today, I said fuck it and downloaded Ren'Py Visual Novel engine, and cook up something using it.

I have no idea why I decided to do this, but I think I just want the instant gratification of making a game, without actually working hard on it, and I had a script in mind that can work as a visual novel...

*Spice & Wolf* last episode for the cour today, and we get to see a lot, and I mean, a lot of Holo cuteness this episode... dear god she's too adorable
