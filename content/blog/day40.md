We spend the day going to the mall as a family, something decided on a whim. They only told me that we're going in the morning, and I can't really complain.

Honestly, I feel like I appreciate this outing a bit more than usual... maybe because my phone died earlier than usual. 

Usually this means I have to weather through awkward pauses, since everyone else is going to be on their phone as well, but my dad's phone also died. My mom is very happy since that means we have to talk to each other, and we did. 

My sister's phone, however, NEVER DIES. She always prepared thoroughly before going out, I never saw her phone's battery dying in any of our family outings.

For the groupwatch today, we are watching *Four Lions*...

Well, uhhh... I really don't know what to say about this movie. My first reaction after the movie's done was "that was... very british". The humor, black and dry as it is, *is* very british. It's very real, caricaturized real problem of extremism and the incompetency of leaders and people in charge (the police and the government).

There's not much else I can say. There are many depictions of moslem people here that might be taken as offensive, but it doesn't feel offensive because it's real. Except Barry... wait no, EVEN BARRY feels real. Like, I can see him existing, that fucking twat.
