I never thought I'll have a joyride on my bike in the rain again, but here I am, knowing that this is a memory that I will cherish for as long as I live probably.

Anyway, as morning comes, it's time for me to say goodbye. It was... I'm sad. I'm just sad. I don't want it to be over, but I know life must go on. I don't say this to these cool peeps, actually, but deep down I'm worried that this is the LAST TIME I'll ever see them in real life like this.

I'll just need to work hard to dispel such nihilistic thoughts then. I WILL meet them again, perhaps in their country instead of mine, or somewhere we all can go to together.

Anyway, school happens. I don't even think I want to explain what happened here, but let's just say I basically just stay in my own world during the class, because I'm kinda distracted with a lot of things, and perhaps trying to mask my sadness.

And after that, the night came, and... well... the situation is good enough that I feel like I can write a story about it. Because of that, I just want to keep it vague, and in case future me, or relevant people, are watching this, I'll make sure to get this romcom story out some day!
