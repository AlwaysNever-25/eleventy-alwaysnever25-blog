In today's Dungeons & Dragons game... we face off against the massive green creature, that we identify as a troll!

Due to setup we managed to pull off last week, including having our Owlin Paladin named Bruder flying near the troll with Compelled Duel active, we were able to deal significant damage to them as we have a few rounds to prepare ourselves. (I deal basically less damage than the others, though. My combat rolls in this session is TRASH!)

Just when we thought it's over though, the creature gets back up for a round two! This time, however, the troll was able to... fly? A weird, but ends up being a very annoying thing for Krir, my character, specifically because he can't reach the guy! I have to try doing a high jump using my Athlete feat in order to at least try to hit him, but I MISSED. I wasn't rolling well this game.

But thankfully my other teammates are very proficient in ranged weaponry. A rogue called Bean, Falgrand the cleric, and Bruder's fiancee and sorcerer Verniece. They were able to cover up my inadequacies... and I, in return, help by making sure the troll's attention are kept towards Krir.

At the end, even though we were dealing decent damage per turn, it wasn't enough to stop the troll from doing significant damage... to Krir! Yes, it was dire, one of the troll's attack hits, and Krir was downed. For something even worse, I immediately rolled a natural 1 for the first death save.

That's not the end. Usually in this case, they would immediately try to revive me because I'm unconscious, right? But you know what happened? The artifact that I held on, that supposedly contains the brother, the target that Death marked for us, activates itself, because I also rolled *Natural freaking 1* on one of the three save needed to resist him! THE OTHER ROLL IS 2 AND 5!

My luck in combat this session is REALLY TRASH.

Anyway, the artifact activates itself, and Krir woke up, not on my control, and he throws cards around, activating effects like summoning the Jack of Hearts, and dealing damage to the troll. It actually helps the team a lot, this interloper's interference. But the thing is, Krir is STILL ROLLING DEATH SAVES. AND THEY CAN'T REALLY METAGAME SINCE HE LOOKS FINE! (Albeit his eyes are white and such.)

Each turns afterwards I was hoping my luck went fine, and you know what happened? KRIR WAS OKAY. I succeeded in the next two death saves, and thankfully the battle was over before I can even roll the third save.

Krir almost died again. This dude, I swear to *God*...

Once the combat is over, we were awarded the fifth level! And after a clutch roll of Persuasion by Verniece, we even get LOOT. Krir got a particularly nice FLAME BATTLE AXE HOLY SHIT I WAS SO HAPPY. After everything he goes through... that was honestly quite the session.
