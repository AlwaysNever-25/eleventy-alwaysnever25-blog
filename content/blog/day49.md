Today... I basically spent 15 hours in bed. It's Sunday, and I don't have to go anywhere. This day might be my last day of being free, as my days are completely filled for the next... two weeks? Crazy, I'm already this busy, and I'm not even working... what if I do...

Today I decided that it's time to get over my slump, because I wanted to read Imosae, but I want to finish Hyouka first. I read the last three chapters in the novel, which was pretty good in my opinion, and so does the rest of the chapters before. I do want to continue reading the *Koten-bu*, or *Classic Clubs*, series... but there's not much that I can say. I guess I can say I like how everything ties to the Classic Clubs? The distant past, the near past, the present, and possibly the future. I can't wait to delve in to the next part of Hyouka.

But... it's time for me to tackle Imosae vol 12... the one after the break up. I want to know what happened.
