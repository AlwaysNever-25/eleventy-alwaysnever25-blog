<summary>Gacha Games stuff, don't look!</summary>

I got Soldier 11 in Zenless Zone Zero... disappointed, but I do like her as well. I just wanted another character... oh well, there's still some more to the game that I haven't explored, so my focus will be gearing towards that.

Also, they got cats

I pulled for one of the best summer character design I've ever seen. Like, holy jesus look at her.

Finished Biniku no Kaori. All bad endings and the true ending. 18/18. Yeah, ALL bad endings... honestly, the very last bad ending is the worst bad ending I've ever read. I think I just need to start something else to take my mind off that. Reaching the true ending made me cry only because of how bad that bad ending was...

I even finished the extra thing

Anyway, I immediately started ATRI, not wasting my time cause the anime is coming soon. Would you look at these screenie!

I'm meeting two of the ladies already, but I had to stop for the time being. The VN felt fresh, mostly because they got all these immersive visual effects. These could've been the norm for other VNs (I'd say 9-nine- has a similar kind of visual effect) but I give them extra points for being a tad more immersive than usual.

*Gimai Seikatsu* starts airing today, and I'd say the vibe for this anime is like that scene in Breaking Bad where they have a silent dinner for one whole minute, it's just... overpowering maturity? The absence of a conversation created this unique atmosphere as these two youngsters learn to live with each other as their parents marry each other, and becoming step siblings in the process.

I can't wait to see where this leads.

*Giji Harem*... oh man... even from the first episode I know for sure this is a GREAT adapatation. This is not the first time I've seen a manga I already read beforehand getting adapted to the screen, but holy forking shit man, they absolutely nailed it. I'm crying, Rin is REAL! Tsundere-chan, Cool-chan, Imp-chan, voiced by YOR FORGER? Oh my gawd, just kill me right now I think I'm in heaven

And you know what else? The OP FUCKING SLAPS. HOLY SHIT IT'S SO GOOD. I LOVE THIS SHIT
