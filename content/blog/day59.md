After the concert yesterday, my ass is beat, but I also have to go to class early in the morning. Thankfully, there's only one class today, so after that's over, I hurry myself over to meet the cool peeps again, who is having their last day shopping. Turns out they're not feeling like going to the marine park after all, wanting to shop instead.

While they were shopping, I stayed around in a cafe with one of the cool peeps (a guy, who doesn't really want to go shopping and wanted to chill), and I played some Darkest Dungeon with him. He cautioned me, saying this game is *very* challenging, and so I should probably get to it. This led me to form a plan for the next month, a rough plan that includes finishing Tomb Raider/Rise of the Tomb Raider in the first week, The Letter in the second week, and then playing Darkest Dungeon for the rest of the weeks left.

This day is also a very important day for me, because after all that shopping by them, I finally decided to take the plunge and shop myself as well, using the cool peeps money that they owe me after I covered for them in buying Ado Merch. I have with me now a brand new XBox controller! (I decided on it because there is no way I'll ever get Playstation, nor would I get a Switch in the near future).

I was actually not supposed to stay here for the night, because I have class tomorrow, but they all finished their shopping a bit later than I expected. So I plead my case to my parents, asking if I can have one last sleepover here, and also gave them an excuse (that I need to settle money with them because we basically covered for each other a lot during their trip here), and it seems like that was an okay reason. They know how important money is anyway. They'll probably kill me if they ever find out how much I spent these past few days though...
