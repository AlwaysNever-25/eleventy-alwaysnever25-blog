April Fools! Especially to me, who returns to a short 5 day class before having an actual break for three weeks... why are they scheduling things like this...

While this is happening, I've been mulling over things for my contracts- kidding, it's April Fools! I just spend the whole day yesterday editing on random wikis I've edited before. I updated *Sasakoi* wiki, applied for *Oshi no Ko* wiki to get spotlighted, edited *Imosae* wiki again, checked over some other wikis....

Meanwhile, my contract progress is left unattended... is what I was going to say, but no, I actually progressed a bit. I finally got to chapter 40 in Your Throne, with the next 20 chapters downloaded. I can probably finish at least this much, since Your Throne is my base contract, I need to finish them quick.

I decided with the little time I have left to focus on what I can do. I'll try to sneak some of *The Letter* in, but I'm not gonna hold up hope on this. *Rise of Tomb Raider*, however, is progressing smoothly. I should've progressed even more during the four-day break, but I was too careless. 

I'm hoping I can appeal to Frazzle about *Darkest Dungeon*. It's not like I have zero progress there, but it's not even close to finishing. I'll start writing review tomorrow, no matter what happens. I should be done with *Tomb Raider either tomorrow or the day after that...
