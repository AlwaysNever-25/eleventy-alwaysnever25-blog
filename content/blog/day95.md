I finished Chapter 4 of *The Letter*, and stopped about halfway through Chapter 5. I also finished basically all but one Challenge Tombs in *Rise of the Tomb Raider*, and approaching the final few parts of the story. In class today, when possible, I'll progress with *The Letter*, aiming to finish Chapter 6 but will be fine if I can get at least halfway there. I'll be home really late today, so I have to make use of my time in uni well, or it'll be over for me.

I haven't even write down all my thoughts regarding the other contracts down... I might have to do that tomorrow, right before I go to class... or even do it IN class.
