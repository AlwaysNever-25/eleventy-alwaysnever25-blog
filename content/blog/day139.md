I have almost a full day class today, filled with attendance shenanigans, and also rushing to finish the dumptruck of assignments that I got during day 137, which I semi-finished today.

Anyway, today my friends also decided to stay over. It was supposed to be a night where we just focus on getting assignments, but it turns into a sleepover night, which was expected. Because of this though, I have no progress on any anime and stuff for the day.

I tried *Path to Nowhere* before my friends came over, seems interesting, but not sure I'll spend my time on it actively, I'm still behind in NIKKE and MementoMori, and I'm a bit passive now in HSR now that I am saving for Firefly. Meanwhile, I'm accumulating stuff on Arknights still, hoping to get Degenbrecher from my only ten pull on her banner later... Shu's banner is coming though, and I'll spend all my stuff on it, so I have to be careful.
