Learned CSS the hard way today... might actually use the thing I'm cooking today for my review... if I have time.

I need to make a decision at this point... do I force myself through all this shit at the cost of my sanity, or put myself first and take my time with all of the games?

I do have to come to terms with the fact that I won't be able to join next season's contract. I guess the question is, would this make me get banned from the contracts from now on if I don't finish *Darkest Dungeon*? I probably will never finish that game in time, no matter what happens.

I'm so tired... yet I still play *Rise of Tomb Raider*. I think I can finish that at least. *The Letter* is also not doable anymore, I feel.
