Preparing for the penultimate Final Exam tomorrow. Unlike the last time though, we don't really have a lot of clues about what the exam will be, so we're just preparing the best that we could. It's about JavaScript, and even though I spent pretty much the whole day, I don't feel as good about the preparation compared to the midterm one.

I'm just hoping I can get through this, cause this is the only course this semester that I'm confident I can get an A for.

Zenless Zone Zero gameplay continues, and I find these two siblings refreshing since the other Hoyoverse characters that I know of is either a hardline alternate characters, or siblings that are tragically separated through space and time. If you know, you know.

I picked Belle (the sister) from the option, yet I find them both dorky and cute. Her bro's name is Wise, and they run a cassete tape(?) or video record store where people go and rent/buy tapes from them. However, they also run a secret business of running as a Proxy, an illegal specialist in the underworld that can travel freely into dangerous place in their world, usually in the area affected by the Hollow. They are both known as Phaethon. Cool name, isn't it?

The story so far just explore the world and their entanglement with one of their recurring client, the Cunning Hares, a mercenary-type group consisting of trio Nicole, Anby, and Billy. The story is... honestly alright, doesn't wow me as much as Wuthering Waves or HSR did, but it doesn't make me want to stop playing either. The game however does give me a weird Persona vibe, from that one time I watched a gameplay of a Persona game.
