Still can't get that Laura Shigihara song out of my mind.

Also, finished Frieren today... I'm feeling a bit empty, not as empty as I thought I'll be. Well, maybe because I'm already feeling empty for a bit before...

Watched *Top Gun: Maverick* today, without ever watching the original *Top Gun*. Good movie, watched it with dad. He skipped over that scene where Maverick goes to Penny's room... XD
