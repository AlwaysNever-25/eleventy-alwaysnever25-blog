First day back to university. That means... random thought during my commute back home time!

Should've been done on Day 4 but I was sick that day.

*Shadow* could have an interesting climax, with the seventh and eighth shadow being the main character's parents. I've already unconsciously put in sprinkles of them behind pretty much every single shadow, beside maybe the first and the fourth. I can tie it easily to them though (arranged marriage for first? parents of fourth being an international client?). My idea for the last one... the last shadow could be the main character himself. Still don't know how to really go about that way, but I'm putting the idea here first in case I want to revisit it later.

Also thinking of writing it in Indonesian first before retranslating it, or rewriting it to English. This brings about a question; if an author of a media wrote something in their original language, and then rewrote it into another language, with different translation and added text, does that mean the author are doing whatever these localizer are doing to anime? Is that an equivalent task?

Day 21 is my secret santa's birthday, and I'm planning to give him the secret santa present on that day if possible. I've written all the verse, bar some revision on the refrain, and the only thing left is for me to record them, and tinker with my recording on the Reaper program. I'm thinking of asking someone else, but I don't want to step on any toes... I began to wonder if I can just straight up ask my secret santa, and see if he notices.

During the commute back home, riding a motorcycle, I was worried that I'm unable to remember all these thoughts I had running about inside my head. (I still believe I'm missing like one or two things that I did think about during the commute.) It reminds me of Lenny from *Memento*, and having no short term memory. It's something that make my stomach churn, cause I did end up forgetting just like him. Memories are unreliable after all, just like he says.

And lastly, I did end up sorting out the attendance thing. Went without a hitch. I feel like a massive weight is lifted off my shoulder, honestly. Well... just to be replaced by even heavier thought of the final exams, and the semester ahead of me. The road is still long...
