I was notified by a certain reader that the website I shipped in early today (finished porting all of my 2020 projects, woohoo) has SHIT display, which means that I have to start seriously considering a theme switcher... and actually make a light theme design for the blog. 

I did that, and now I'm tackling the problem of switching theme with a single click.

I also went to do some private stuff regarding my family, and realizing that my life could just be upended at any moment's notice, which is... saddening.

I feel the need to sit on this bench...

Why do I feel... so much... POWER?!
