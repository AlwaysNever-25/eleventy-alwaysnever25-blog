*Roshidere* has the final boss introduced, Maria Mikhailovna Kujou. Honestly... she's the very close second in my best girl list, especially since-

Okay, not the time to reveal that yet, but it's pretty clear from the context clues given on the anime, if you know, you know.

Masha... I like her a lot since she is a hugger, a personal weakness of mine other than the degenerate stuff that Yuki would do. I'd argue that hugging is the bigger kind of weakness, and seeing her pamper Kuze is just... so peak...

Wow look at that, I have Changli!

At some point in time this Changli does have deeper voice and longer white hair but of course after spending more pulls, she came home safe and sound. 🥰

I also found myself with two new characters that I will NEVER level up, because this game demands me to level up only the best of the best character. 🥰

Anyway, I finally find the strength in me to finish Yinlin's quest.

It's really good, and the line Yinlin ride between being bad and good, I like it a lot.
