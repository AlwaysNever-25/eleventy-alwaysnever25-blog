*Spy x Family Season 2* cruise arc properly ends with episode 10, as we have a cute little holiday sequence with the full family, and cute moment at the end there as Yor finally plops down defenseless, tired after all the mishaps that happens in the previous two days... being carried by Loid. Along with Anya as well...

And the aftermath of the cruise can also be felt by everyone, but I have to cut things short, the next two episode will be the final time I am interacting with *Spy x Family* anime, so I'll take my time...

*Oshi no Ko Season 2* continues with the episode about Abiko's righteous anger towards Goa and oof... it hurts seeing her words voiced, cause goddamn if a writer I'm a fan of say that about me, I don't know if I can recover... also, we get to see some more Akane this episode, truly the season of Akane...

Music contract started today, and I created a playlist after going through my liked video on YouTube, with these tracks:

- *Can You Hear The Music* - Ludwig Goransson (Oppenheimer Soundtrack)
- *Parallel Night* - Ririsya
- *Boy of the Year* - Warren Hue
- *Let It Happen* - Louis Cole
- *above the time* (시간의 바깥) - IU
- *Enchanted* - Chloe x Halle
- *Photograph* - Jaden
- *Sugarpluem Elegy* - NIKI
- *Story 2* - clipping.
- *Street Livin'* - Black Eyed Peas
- *When You Wake Up* - Laura Shigihara
- *Memory 1, 2, 3, 4 & Bounding Through Time Mix* - Super Paper Mario Soundtrack

I'm actually very satisfied with these song as my entry, especially the Mario soundtrack that just has to be in there for personal reasons. The songs kinda follow a melancholy vibe to it, at least that's what I feel... except *Story 2*, which is there because it's lyrics is melancholy, not the song itself... okay that's kinda a reach I just really like the song and wanted to put it in lmao

Before the steam sale ends, I ended up buying *Root Letter*... yeah, that's the Visual Novel I was talking about a few days ago. Sigh...
