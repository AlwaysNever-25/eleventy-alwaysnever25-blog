For the first time in a few weeks, I finally progressed in my contracts! Not gonna mean I'll get out of the woodwork anytime soon, but now that my break is starting, I want to see if I can get to finish at least all of the games I got contracted with, except Darkest Dungeon since I've lost hope on that, and all the review for the non-games I have.

Progress on those contracts are as follows... I'll refrain from speaking about my plans on these, because I did plan the whole month and I ended up blowing off all those plans, which means that I'll just do things my own way.

- Magus of the Library: Done! Review is underway
- Non Non Biyori: Minimum threshold reached! If time doesn't permit me to finish the whole series (I'm missing 10 eps from season 2, season 2 OVA, and the rest of season 3 + OVA) I'll go ahead and make a short review.
- Your Throne: 38/60 for minimum threshold. This is doable.
- Rise of the Tomb Raider: Finished with the Tomb Raider (2013)! Rise of the Tomb Raider is 27% complete, doable to finish before deadline.
- The Letter: Did a part of the first chapter. Unsure if doable before deadline, but I can try.
- Darkest Dungeon: I'll take the L for this one, gonna be the reason why I'll be banned for the next season.

Also for the first time in weeks, I have another "all-nighter" VC... it was just as fun as I remembered it to be.

I guess these good times has not yet passed.
