*Chainsaw Man* gets crazy as I finally get to the crazy scene involving Makima and Future Devil. Honestly, I need to reread it again, is the Future Devil really this goofy in the manga? I swear, I remember feeling dread from him... but I must've misremembered it.

Got called to the office today, to fix more problems with the PC I installed months ago during around day 29. Took me almost the whole day just banging my head against the wall cause the problem is just so vague. I had to restart the PC multiple time until it finally fixes itself... it's not even during the first two restarts that fixes it, so I can't really say the old trick of "rebooting your PC" works this time. There's also some commands that I put in that might've helped, I don't know... I get paid for my time though, which was awesome.
