Someone's birthday is today, I wish them a happy birthday and good luck to their future journey that they will undertake soon. The bastard better survive...

I've been working on some scripts for the past few days, in python. I'm not sure if this is productive cause I'm actually more interested in learning more Javascript, but Python is as easy to learn for me as it was years ago, when I tried to follow a guide to make a game from the pygame library...

Anyway, for now, I've managed to create two scripts for two of the wikis I oversee, hopefully it works... one of the script is still (question mark) for me, so I need to get that in order before the GitHub actions automated the script next week Wednesday...
