So... I tried PCSX2 today, *the* emulator for PS2 games, and I decided to download the PS2-exclusive VN called *Amagami*. (Okay, they also have a PSP version, but that's another emulator entirely).

No... I don't think I'll play this game, since it doesn't really run well (it crashes and the translation are sometimes off centered visually), but I'll see what I feel about it in the next few days.

Speedran through *Akarui Kioku Soushitsu*, and turns out there is a plot behind all the silly jokes between Arisa and Mari-san. Honestly, at some point I thought the plot was getting too repetitive, especially at the amount of time Arisa keeps alternating between being shy and wanting to love Mari, but thankfully they stopped just before I get annoyed by it... okay no, they actually stopped just before the annoyance became too much for me. I did get annoyed, but this is a short 4-koma manga with ten pages each, so it's nothing that I would get so angry about.

Anyway, the ending was sweet, but I wouldn't rate this high. I'll give the whole series a 7/10.
