Having a bit of a freakout because of potentially trivial things. I'm sorry for those affected by my emotional ramblings, either by me ranting in the dms or just getting the cold shoulder.

It's really hard to stop once you are spiralling, but I feel some kind of difference when I compare this situation with things that I experienced early in life. I guess this is really what they call maturing, huh? There's not much hormones messing around with my brain and making me go crazier than I am normally...

Watched *Sasakoi* and *Spice & Wolf* today for the current season anime. *Spice & Wolf* in particular is very engaging as the story seems to reach its first climax, and holy shit I can experience the waifu that is Holo now... she's so precious... screenshot graciously provided by a friend who streamed the episodes.

Inching slowly close with *Mato* as well, four episodes left. Not gonna be able to watch for the next couple of days, cause I'm battling the biggest exams out of this batch. Wish me luck...
