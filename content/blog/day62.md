Today's class are all cancelled, and I only realized it once I got to my uni, whilst it was raining outside. I can't even go home even if I want to... I hate my life.

Other than that, I spent the day lazing around, until afternoon, where I have to face a situation I've been dreading.

I dreaded the day I had to meet this group of friends that cut me off from their friendship, but turns out I was worrying for nothing.

I don't know why, but I feel like now that we talk again, there's this weight that are lifted off my back. Like, we "ended" our friendship in the most unfriendly way, but turns out it's all because of some miscommunication stemming from my pandemic reclusivity and them talking about my github stuff. Gonna be honest, I am still a bit miffed that they're probably talking shit about my github progress, but I'm glad I wasn't discouraged by them mocking it to my face. I guess having some time off from them is a good thing, but now I'm willing to let it all go. They're not someone I'll share my whole entire life story for, but we can hang out from time to time.

Now, hanging out with them does cut off time from the people who I cherish more than them, but I digress. Jackbox time! I wasn't able to join them in time, being late by a few hours because of hanging out with the friend I mentioned above, but I managed to sneak in before the party's over.

We had some fun! It reminds me of those time back in the days, in the server we all shared our interest in. Those days are never coming back, but it can be recreated sometimes... just like this day.
