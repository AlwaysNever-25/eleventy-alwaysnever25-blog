Steam Sale today... man, I wish I have some money but I don't have anything to spend. I need to find some work

Wuthering Waves 1.1 Patch Release day!

...but I spend it instead finishing the story from 1.0... heheh... yeah, safe to say the game fell to the wayside for me as I focus on a lot of things in the past few weeks, but I'm back now, ready to grind to get Changli!

Before we do that though, let's finish the 1.0 main story first, and holy shit some of these scenes are just paintings

Outside of the epic scenes, we also have scenes like this when Rover is in tears HUEEEE wejfskhfshfl

And we get to meet the "Little One", also known as Abby. Seems like this is the "Paimon" of this world, for sure. They are playing it up to be cute, but also Abby is pretty sarcastic, which I enjoy a lot :D
