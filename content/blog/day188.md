Third Final Exam... I don't really know what to feel about this one. I think I did well, I wrote in all the answers according to the crammed knowledge of the course that I did just a few minutes before the exam, but my cram results during midterms was not that good. It could be possible that I might fail this course too... I'm hoping that's not the case.

Continued ATRI, and honestly, the visual is breathtaking...

But I reached a point where I have to pick a choice. I don't know if I want to do this without a guide just yet, but it's so tempting to me...

Also continued playing Zenless Zone Zero...

I started playing a wordle-like game based on *Arknights* for the past week, introduced by a friend of mine, and I just got probably my best possible result I could ever get with this game.

[Arknights Wordle](https://ak-wordle.three6ty1.dev/) #155<br>
Operator guessed in 3 tries.<br>
🟩🟥🟥🟥🟩⬇️⬇️<br>
🟩🟥🟥🟥🟩🟩🟩<br>
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩<br>

If you want to try these, go right ahead and click above, it should lead to the website.

(Future Al note: I wrote this about two weeks in the future, about Day 206. The links used to be different, as they changed the website used to host the game to a different website, and so it have been changed to that website. I also don't remember the answer for this day's puzzle, so that's why I didn't talk about it that much teehee)
