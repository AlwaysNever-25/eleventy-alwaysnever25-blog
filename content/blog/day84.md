Nothing can wake me up more to my depressing lack of motion in life than the fact that I just drove my family whilst listening to Katy Perry's "Peacock".

I don't think my 20 year-old me would have expected that his life would be this way four years later, turning into basically a glorified driver/butler for your own family.

Well, that young me wouldn't have expected to learn about all this web dev shit too, so I guess... I found my own way to it. Goddamnit Dune, why are you so quotable...

Tried to make some script to automate page creation on wikis, but these programming language got hands, ouch.

When is a door not a door?

When is the right time to interact with someone again after something awkward happens between them?

When will things start to be back to normal?

Is there ever a normal after all this?

The answer really lies on me but I once again refuse to answer like the person I am.
