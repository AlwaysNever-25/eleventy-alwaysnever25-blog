Today I am currently on the National Library, spending time after my class (and brief excursion to my own university's library), to gather B-Rolls for my potential review on *Magus of the Library*. I'm here currently with my sister, who also brought her friends, and she's here for a more serious goal, to get references for her thesis.

For the amateur B-Rolls I'm attempting to make, I am going to use my mom's *Sony A6000* camera, which is carried with an entire box due to how it has detachable lens, and I'm carrying that with me as well. I was going to bring my sister's *Gorilla* tripod, for additional shoots of me in the libraries, but I decided against it because the box already make my bag too bulky for me.

Currently asking my more experienced friend regarding the settings for each shoot, I'm getting some recommendation but I'm still very much feeling lost about it all. I'll just record some random stuff and see how I feel about it as I moved it back to my PC.

I also watched The Truman Show tonight. I'll say this, I've known what it was about for years, watching clips of the movie on YouTube, but I enjoyed the movie nonetheless. Now I get the complete picture of what drives Truman to go through such length to be free of his role as the star of the show.

It is *crazy* though that he basically takes cutout of women's magazine in order to have a picture of Sylvia... I didn't expect that coming in. That's the only thing that surprises me in this movie, other than the amount of blatant advertising that they have. This was made in 1998... how can it already predict what's currently going on in 2024? Crazy...
