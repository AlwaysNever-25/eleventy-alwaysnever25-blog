Pool time with my homies, after class. I won two times, even tried a trickshot where I put the cue on my back. The position was really easy for me to put the ball in, and I succeded, naturally. I wanna play some again when I can... 

Learned some new HTML stuff too today, about forms and such. I already dawdled with it before, but this is something I didn't know it can do. I can start my college project now with this kind of knowledge I think.

For the past few days I've started playing through *Darkest Dungeon* again. I managed to kill some bosses, but I'm still very far from getting to the end. There's so much grind... but it's looking hopeful. If I can keep grinding like this everyday, I can get to it before the contract ended. My review for it won't be as creative, but I'm okay with that.
