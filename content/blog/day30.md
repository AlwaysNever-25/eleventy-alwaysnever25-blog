I spent the midnight until the morning binging through *Koi wo Shiranai Bokutachi wa*. It was probably a typical shojo romance for people who have read a lot of those before, but for me this is something really great. I think it's just my lack of awareness in the genre rearing its ugly head once more, but I really enjoy all the characters here, Ikezawa being my favorite female character but Eiji and Fujimura as my favorite couple. I don't particularly like both Fujimura and Eiji that much, but their developments were inducing quite the happy groan inside of me. Taichi though... Taichi is my goat. I'm just a bit sad that Naohiko and Izumi's story didn't grip me as hard, but it's mostly because their story are atypical of a love triangle story between childhood friends, which I've read before. It still hurts though, when that culture festival incident happened.

All of those are needed though, because holy shit Fujimura and Eiji development afterward was... *chef's kiss* awesome. Not afraid to give this a 9/10.

I also spend the day with my college friends, hanging out and eating through mountains of food in an all-you-can-eat restaurant. We spend the time together from 4pm until 8pm, and it took us a bit to get home. By the time I get home, I'm already spent. Not really what I envisioned my week-long holiday going to be, but it's better than what is coming for me tomorrow.
