Some of my friends stayed over tonight to study together for this quiz we're having. We ended up sleeping by 2-3 AM, but the quiz is like at 3PM anyway...

We studied a lot about CSS, which I already kinda dabbled before, so they were asking me a lot about it, but I'm not exactly the master at it. I just know more than them, and now I think they starting to know a lot more than me... I'm getting caught up by them.

Anyway, it was fun. This is probably going to be the last sleepover I'll have with these bozos...

We did the quiz, felt like I did quite well, but not gonna hope too high. Last time I did that, I got slapped with a mid grade. I'm just going to think my grade is going to be mid as well.

I'm not feeling well though after everything that is happening. I'm so... tired... tomorrow I have to go as well...

Must persevere... tomorrow is the last day before a short break...
