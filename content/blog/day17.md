Starting to work on putting my Two Thousand Twenty Words project [here](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/tags/two-thousand-twenty-words/). I also considered putting up stories here, stories that might be a bit undercooked though. I'm keeping big, potentially working out story on my main website.

Today we got Dr. Ratio on *Honkai: Star Rail*. Ah yes, I must've forgot to put this in, I'm a gacha addict. Well... for the most part. I used to be very addicted to them for the past year, but lately during these winter breaks, I've been neglecting them all. My main game was AK (*Arknights*) and  HSR (*Honkai: Star Rail*) actually, with a bit of *Genshin Impact* (a bit late, but I was one of the people who tried 1.0 but quit afterwards) and *NIKKE* (I don't know if I want to start that again...).

Anyway, yeah, a free character. I didn't expect that from this game, so it was a nice surprise. I'm currently just trying to see if I can level up everyone I have in HSR, and my current goal is to get Sparkle from a future banner, and Jingliu from a rerun (please don't put them together).

I also started rewatching *Paripi Koumei* anime last night, continued today. My goal is to get that done ASAP, along with *Dead Mount Death Play* (got through episode 9 yesterday night as well).
