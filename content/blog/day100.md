Getting back to listening to Kendrick... reminded again how much I love *Poetic Justice*... and how that song features Drake whom he is currently beefing with. Man, it's been a decade since that song came out...

Otherwise, I've been doing some random stuff... helping my mom with stuff around the house... getting soaked from my head down to my toe... the things I do for my family.

I also watched the second episode of *Spice and Wolf: Merchant Meets The Wise Wolf*! This remake has been in my radar for so long, and I found myself into an impromptu groupwatch group that is going to watch this weekly. I'm slowly becoming a seasonal weeb...

Played some *The Finals* and more *Darkest Dungeon*. For the latter at this point, I think I should bite the bullet and try beating the first "Darkest Dungeon" quest. I've been having difficulties keeping everyone low level enough, the list of my resolve 6 heroes are filling up the list...
