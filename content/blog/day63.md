For the past couple of days, I've actually progressed quite a bit in my Tomb Raider (2013) playthrough, and I end the day today knowing I can finish the game tomorrow. This does throw a wrench in my plans, because I was expecting myself to finish this game earlier than this, but I can still make it in time. Only if I finish it tomorrow and go straight on progressing with Rise of the Tomb Raider, though...
