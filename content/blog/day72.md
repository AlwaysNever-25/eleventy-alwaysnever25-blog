For the past couple of weeks I wondered... why am I the only one who is not sick while my entire household is sick? Now I get the answer.

I was riding the high. And now, it crashes down. No, it's not just normalizes itself, it *crashes* down. Hard.

I've had fever before, so I don't know if this fever can be considered something unique, but I'd want to attribute it to something, at least. It's the first time I can ever pinpoint myself getting sick because I was *distressed* of a problem in my life.

Well, not like I don't have this before, but I don't remember them anymore. Not sure I'll ever forget this for a long time.
