Watched *Mato Seihei no Slave* and the sixth episode of *Dead Mount Death Play* today. Both are not as good as I'd like them to be, but not enough for me to drop them.

I also watched *The Dark Knight* today, with the groupwatch peeps. The movie actually holds up in my opinion, and the subtle story beats I picked up on the rewatch was very satisfying to catch.

Also I have a pounding headache...
