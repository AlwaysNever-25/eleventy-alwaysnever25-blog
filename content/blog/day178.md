Continuing from yesterday, I'm converting one of my story/script into a Visual Novel. I'm starting to add more and more stuff that was not on the script, since the script on its own is already very bare. Now that I also have to see the script in detail, I noticed a lot of flaws in my writing... :((((

I guess I'm going to cook this thing after all...

Update on the above, I thought I can just serve this on something like itch.io, but I don't feel comfortable sharing an incomplete game to that website... I'll work on it some more in the coming months. If I can make this work...
