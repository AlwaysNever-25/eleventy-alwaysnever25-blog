I'm catching up with *Paripi Koumei* today, finishing three more episodes and ***finally*** bringing them up closer to the ending. I've been putting this on hold for too long.

I also started playing *Arknights* again after so long. I've actually been playing for a week or so now, and I've finished all the stages in the new event, *So Long Adele*. I usually would read the story for these, but I kinda not feeling the story of *Arknights* for a while now. I'm feeling the burnout. To be honest, I even missed a whole ass event, when I usually would be there to get the medals, at least.

But the good thing about catching up now is that I get enough materials to roll for at least one six star... and my summer banner luck is not as shit as last year, thankfully. I got the Limited Eyjafjalla alter, Eyjafjalla the Hvit Aska. I also managed to get enough golden certificate to buy the actual Eyjafjalla, someone I never rolled on all the rolls I've had before she was sequestered into the kernel banner.

I feel like it's good to be back to Arknights, at least.
