You should notice that my website now look... wayyyyy better than before. It's because I figured how to mess with the look of the website! Enjoy reading through a hopefully better experience, but now I have to use this knowledge for my own project that I need to finish soon...

Just found out that class is cancelled today, which is good, cause I have more time exploring Wuthering Waves...

Warning! Even More Wuthering Waves related stuff

Sooo... I finished Lingyang's Companion Quest, which was pretty okay (I don't have much opinion on it, but...

Did you know that it's illegal to have an NPC that is too attractive? Kuro Games apparently doesn't care, cause LOOK AT HER JESUS WHYYYYY SHE'S SO CUTE SHE'S ONLY AN NPC

Don't mind me, I'm just posting two beautiful people meeting with each other for the first time (holy shit I kinda dig it but I know there's someone even better in the future but like gkdshfjdhfsdfkh Jinhsi so dignified and honestly cute with the Rover I swear I'm not a shipper-)

Okay, enough with the Rover and Jinhsi love, they're not the only characters we see in the story.

They do make a deadly trio though.

I have more images but I feel like it would make this become too much of a gushing session? So I'll end it before it gets there. I do want to say though, the story does get pretty good after Scar appears, and I feel like the criticism that the story was weak before he appears... do hold up. The story instantly gets better after Scar appeared, it's insane.

But anyway, we're progressing slowly...

I might have involved myself in something that I have never involved myself in before... if this works, I'm actually going to be bugging... turns out, networking DOES work?!

Anyway, things will be clear in a few days, we'll see what happens.
