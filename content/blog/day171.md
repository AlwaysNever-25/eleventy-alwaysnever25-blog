*Spice and Wolf* this week, and they finally have the climax of the conflict as Holo fights against the treasonous merchants, and also begrudingly saves Nora. The animation is gorgeous this week, and I feel satisfied by the conclusion...

My friend stayed over today to finish a last minute assignment, which we kinda half-assed finished. after this is done, all I need to do is take the class tomorrow and on Saturday before I am given a grace period of one week. After that, I'll have my finals... and after that, summer break. Potentially my last summer break, cause next year I should either be working or be jobless, and that's not a summer break no more.
