Drake dropped a weak diss track as a response today... honestly, that diss is so low effort I can already feel the momentum of this beef is just dying down, not on Drake's favor though... bro really do try to tootsie slide off this one, ngl, what the fuck is this track bro

I was pissed today, but I don't know if it's because the circumstances made me or because I was dead tired-

Probably the latter to be honest.
