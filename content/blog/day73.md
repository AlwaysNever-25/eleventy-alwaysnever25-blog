I'm sick, had to take online classes again, and didn't even do the fasting.

Can't even open my laptop or PC... or at least not for long. I feel woozy everytime I have to sit in front of the PC. The worst thing in the world to feel, for me.

But I did end up finally opening my physical volume of *Sachi-iro no One Room*, and finished 1.5 volume (volume 8 and half of volume 9). Masked Boy (or as we know him now, 'Haru') is pretty cute once he smiled.
