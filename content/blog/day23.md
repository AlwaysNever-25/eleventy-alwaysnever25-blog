So... another exam today. Just like the previous exam, I did not have enough time to do everything required in the case. This time though, it's purely because of my own foolishness. I would have definitely made it if I was able to figure it out in time, but three hours passed by in a flash...

I'm not expecting high grade from this one, but I already worked my ass off on the other grading requirement for this course, so I'm hoping that it'll soften the blow at least. This is just the beginning of the gauntlet I'll be facing this week though... and this was supposed to be something I was confident at.

Not a great start to the week, I'd say.
