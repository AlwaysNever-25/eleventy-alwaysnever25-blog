Last night, just before sleeping, I managed to complete *Dead Mount Death Play* anime. Even though looking at it, it really does follow the manga panels down to a tee (sometimes this is a good thing), the animation just cannot be compared to the manga, unfortunately. The manga is also very *dense*, so the slightest thing they cut affects my enjoyment of the story as a whole (and they cut a *lot*). 

This is still only the first part though, there's still the second part that I haven't watched yet, so I'll be sure to watch that as well to form a complete review of this series.
