Last night, just before sleeping, I managed to complete *Dead Mount Death Play* anime. Even though looking at it, it really does follow the manga panels down to a tee (sometimes this is a good thing), the animation just cannot be compared to the manga, unfortunately. The manga is also very *dense*, so the slightest thing they cut affects my enjoyment of the story as a whole (and they cut a *lot*). 

This is still only the first part though, there's still the second part that I haven't watched yet, so I'll be sure to watch that as well to form a complete review of this series.

I also have moved the entire month of January 2020 in writing to the blog now, and it was fun to see a younger me still having vigor in his life. Still full of love. Man...

Also I didn't realize how much things has changed over the past four years looking at the writing again. I feel like I didn't fully write what I thought at the time, focused too much on making sure I sounded upbeat? Or maybe I was just actually that upbeat compared to now? Man, time does fly, though. I read about playing CS GO and feeling FPS drop, which is what I attributed my loss with usually, but now I play with no FPS drop at all, and I still lose a lot. I don't know if it's because of age now... god *please*...
