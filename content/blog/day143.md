Today I have an extra class in the afternoon that I decided to take online instead, because I mistakenly thought today is the release day of *Wuthering Waves*. Boy, how wrong I was...

Anyway, to cope with the disappointment, I ended up working on the Wiki scripts that has been stewing in the background for so long. I worked on the scripts locally at first, starting from [day 84](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day84/), and working on it in the background. I had some help from a friend that gives me a bit of information that ended up helping me figure things out. 

After wrangling with these for two whole months... it all finally clicked. The script works, and it's even automated using GitHub Actions (again, this is all possible thanks to a certain person, the very same person).

Even better news, inspired by this win, I ended up working the problem I've had with applying CSS on the blog, and safe to say I think I finally figured things out! The blog now will look a bit different than before. I'm pretty sure only one person know the previous drab look of the blog, so... congratulations, you lucky son of a gun.

Armed with this knowledge, it's now possible for me to really overhaul the entire blog to my whim. I have some ideas about making the home page animated and including all these stars as archive, just like the one I see in my college's laboratory website.
