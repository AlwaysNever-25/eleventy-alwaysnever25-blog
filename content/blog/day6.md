Today I felt like an idiot, worrying about the deadline of projects when it turns out there is no deadline today. All my friends are sitting calmly while I lost my shit.

Due to above, I was unable to get to watch *Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu* anime to completion, so I'll miss the premiere of the second season. It's a shame, but I can catch up the day after tomorrow, because tomorrow I'll be busy.

Today we managed to finish *Batman Begins*, and after the umpteenth time of watching this movie it only clicks to me now how... the movie is filled with explosion for some reason. I never really rated this movie that high to begin with, as it is probably the lowest rated one out of the trilogy (which is a common take), but it's pretty sad that the movie doesn't get better on a rewatch.
