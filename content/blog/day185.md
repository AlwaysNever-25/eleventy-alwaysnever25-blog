A bit sick today but I have another final exam to tackle...

Aaaaaaand I forgot to bring my ID card. Welp. Maybe I am *really* sick.

*Oshi no Ko Season 2* premiere today! I got swamped with wiki stuff at the same time because of course we got to prepare for anime and new chapter at the same time (yeah, they released at the same time, just like on Season 1...)

I watched OnK with other people on the regular groupwatch, and honestly, the premiere is strong. They changed a lot of stuff from the manga so it's not exactly the same, and the way they did it is interesting... and the OP and the ED is really good too! It's still not *Idol* and *Mephisto*, but I like them as well!

*Roshidere* is also released at the same day, so even though I'm sick today, I have a lot of things I gotta watch...

Anyway, *Roshidere* starts immediately with showcase of Alisa/Alya, including the famous leg scene from the novel. We get to see a lot of her charming personality and Russian voice over by Sumire Uesaka, and the slow introduction to everyone else like Yuki and Maria/Masha... strong premiere, and apparently the ED will be different for each episode.
