Trip finished with no other stuff to comment on. Took some good pictures, but I can't really share it here. We go back home a bit early, and I don't know why, but I thought I'll have some good time finally playing *Wuthering Waves* and grind, but it seems like the anger from yesterday just bubbles over and I just feel it dragging down my body with them... or maybe I'm just sick and lost control of my emotions- is that even possible? I don't know.

Anyway, low energy at the end of the day. I hate it.
