Something heinous has come to the forefront of my mind. It made me stay up all night instead of sleeping for the morning classes, which made me groggy throughout the class. It was... a yuri manhwa. It's not just *any* yuri manhwa... it's a *furry* yuri manhwa.

Let's just say I'm knee deep in that manhwa now, and that made me forget basically about everything today.

Watched the first Jason Bourne movie today, *Bourne Identity*. It's pretty hard to understand the movie because he spent some time on it talking on a foreign language, and the subs doesn't translate that (apparently it does get translated but the player my friend are using did not catch it). Other than that, it's a tense movie that got me at times, which perfectly illustrate how it manage to have this paranoid vibes, that I think continues up until the third movie. I'll be watching the next two movies tomorrow as a marathon.
