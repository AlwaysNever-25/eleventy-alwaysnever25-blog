I have to attend to my mother today. I was actually ready to chill for the week, and maybe play Zenless Zone Zero that I predownloaded already... but family calls. I can't ignore them.

Played some Zenless Zone Zero. They opened their server today.

Since I come from *Wuthering Waves*, the controls feel a bit similar, especially with the dodging and stuff, but otherwise it's a complete simplification of the system, with limited options available to me as a player now since it took so long for them to start opening the part of the game where we pull for characters. I don't remember having that feeling for *Honkai: Star Rail*, or even for *Wuthering Waves* (perhaps for the latter, there is a bit of time between them), but so far, I'm having just a chill time... mash clicking the left button. That's really all I need to do to finish a level in this game...

I reached the climax for *Biniku no Kaori*, but due to my current situation where my dad is sleeping in my room, I have to cut things short cause he came in just as I reached it. It was RIGHT THERE, I just need at least an hour... WHYYYYYY
