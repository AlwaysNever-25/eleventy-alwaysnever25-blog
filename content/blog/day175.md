continuing my progress in Watch_Dogs, game is a lot of fun, actually. I'm still surprised that there are some people that plays this game online? I keep getting invaded, which is the online gimmick for this game, and these players can straight up fuck me up, or tail me, or do whatever, and it's kinda neat idea.

until you want to progress with the main mission and whoop, you're invaded. Happens twice that it makes me kinda annoyed, man....
