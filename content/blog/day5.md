Worked on the beer page for Imosae, as I started volume 4. Kaiko.... anyway, I'll just work on it more.

Continued watching *Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu* anime, episode 5 through 8. I'm on time to watch it before the season 2 drops in Sunday, day 7.

Got a movie groupwatch today, working our way through films directed by the honorable Christopher Nolan. We went on watching his premiere debut film *Following* a week ago, and now doing a double feature of his iconic film, *Memento*, and the Norwegian film adapatation *Insomnia*.

*Memento* was as mind bending as his later movies be, especially in the likes of *Tenet* or *Inception*. The way the movie is structured was supposed to represent how life like for the main character Lenny, who is afflicted by Anterograde Amnesia. He is played by Guy Pearce, and honestly it gave me fear to watch someone basically losing his memories after a couple of minutes.

Someone could just mouth you off and treats you like shit, deprive you of methods you can use to try and remember it, and then once you forget, acts like another person entirely to throw you off. This happened to Lenny in the movie, and the thought made me shiver.

The other movie, *Insomnia* are about a case in Alaska, investigated by two LAPD officers doing it out of a favor. The setting of this movie doesn't interest me at first, but once the inciting incident happens, which was Al Pacino's character, Det. Will Dormer, accidentally shooting his partner through the fog, we were treated by a compelling story about guilt, justice, and the depravity of a man willing to do whatever's necessary to get to his goal.

Both movies have this distinct style that I recognize to be Nolan's fingerprint. Quick flashes or cuts to a scene when people are talking about a specific memory, or the way the action scene is set to be as realistic as possible... I was his fans only through his famous films, but his earlier films are just as good, if not better than I expected it to be.

His entire filmography is quite the list, and we're only in the first few films he made. Tomorrow we're planning to take on another two movies, one of which is part of the trilogy that made me aware of his names, *The Dark Knight Trilogy*, starting with *Batman Begins*, and then also *The Prestige* if we feel up for it.

Also, we were treated to a TomSka sketch in between the two movies, and watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0WynQgUlWo) after watching Memento is quite funny, for some reason.
