Happy Eid Mubarak!

So... today I beat the first darkest dungeon quest!

I also finished Bokuyaba, it's basically a 10/10 adaptation. It brought tears to my dead eyes, and dead life. It's just... so peak...

After I finished that anime, I decided to catch up with most of my stalled mangas as well, like *Eminence in Shadow* and this girl who looks like a cat but not a cat girl romcom, *Tonari no Neko to Koi Shirazu*.
