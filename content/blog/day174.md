Last class for the semester is over, from now on, it's GAME TIME!

decided to try playing Watch_Dogs with controller, the difference is immediate... the driving became smoother, and combat gets this mechanism called focus to help me aim, which is tolerable. Coming after Tomb Raider where I have no such thing (I think?) is a welcome change, and the hacking mechanic is actually very enjoyable for me... until I can't find a good entry point with my camera in some of the puzzles in this game goddammit
