Finished *My Dress-Up Darling*. This is a great adaptation, they cooked with this. Say no more, see the reason why.

Lost an entire party to the second Darkest Dungeon quest today... the tragic thing was almost covered in a recording (I was recording for a review purposes) but thankfully it cuts out just right before the final fight. I don't have to relive that painful thing all over again... man, I lost some good character there, a really good Man-At-Arms too...

I can sense my will regarding this game just drops. Not even sure I want to review it anymore. I mean, this is the game though, but I think with this I'll just take my time with it. I don't want to stress too much, game supposed to be an escape for me.
