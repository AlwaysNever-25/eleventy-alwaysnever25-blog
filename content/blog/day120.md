Went on a trip... dunno if adrenaline props me up the whole way but I didn't feel sick at all, even through all the rides I go through... okay, maybe the last few rides gives me a nausea more than what I would usually feel, but anyway... it was fun! This is the same amusement park that I go to back on [day 57](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day57/), and I used the experience to guide some of my friends who goes here for the first time.

I also make sure to take a lot of pictures, which was something that I sadly didn't do the last time, because I didn't charge my camera properly... and I also didn't buy many pictures from the ride we take... and basically lacks a lot of preparation... I'm starting to find fault in my previous visit here...

(Okay, me, yes I'm talking to you, please focus on today.)

Anyway, this makes me want to visit this amusement park with someone I know, cause I saw a ton of couples walking by... honestly, I wouldn't even comment on this if it was only one or two couples, but it's hard to ignore them when I can see them basically every five minutes...

I also didn't go on the big Ferris Wheel on this visit, just like the previous time (yeah, I somehow missed it two times, for vastly different reason). The next time, I'll definitely ride them as the sun sets, and it'll be magical...
