Today is packed with events, so much so that now it's positive I will not finish *Darkest Dungeon* in time.

But... the events that happened is a pretty important one. It's my ten-year reunion with my old friend from middle school. This was something that I thought I'll never come to back when middle school was over, cause I thought I'll never survive that long. Younger me is a bit fucked up...

But anyway, I got to meet some old classmates and they look a lot different than what I remember them. It was a lot more fun than I anticipated. I actually dreaded coming over to this gathering, because there is a certain guy that I do not want to meet again in any circumstances, and he supposedly going to come as well. Fortunately, it seems like he can't come.

There's also another person that supposed to come that I feel ambivalent about, but she also didn't come. I am a bit bummed out about her missing this though, cause I feel like out of everyone, her life story would probably be the most interesting, but maybe it is for the best.

I dipped the ten-year reunion early to hang out with my mates from college. It's not like I didn't want to stay with them, I stayed for like almost three hours, I just wanted to meet my mate as well before the fasting month is over.

We talked for a long time, until almost after midnight. I'm kinda happy that there are people I can do this with, because for the last 4 years or so, I've been unable to do this kind of stuff cause of the pandemic, obviously. And after pandemic's over, I was worried that I will never have another chance to hang out in real life like this again with another person.
