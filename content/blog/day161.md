In the morning, I went on a morning run with my friends, for fun and also to film some stuff for our class.

I met some old friends, and some new ones. I got to see my President. Yes, that guy, *the* President of my country. The last time I have this experience was years ago, in the amusement park that I got to go to in [day 57](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day57/) and [day 120](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day120/). And it was with the previous era's president, nonetheless.

Anyway, we had some fun time hanging out, but there's nothing else to say.

Seen her before, but actually seeing her in my own game kinda intensifying this feeling that I have for her-

They're *really* close...

Oh, speaking of which, Verina! She's pretty cute.
