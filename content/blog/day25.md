The first hour of being twenty-four, I spent opening the gift that she sends me. We talked over Whatsapp, and I posted some vague story about being 24 in Instagram. One person replied, and I replied to a separate, non-birthday related story by a former underclassman. I also recorded some stuff and takes picture of the gift I got. A bag, a wallet, a card holder, and a cable protector. My dad also say "Happy Birthday" to me.

The second hour of being twenty-four, I finally caved and installed the Tachiyomi update to version 15.0.3, because I can't read one of the manga I want to read, being *Kanojo ga Senpai ni NTR-reta node, Senpai no Kanojo wo NTR-masu*... the irony is not lost on me since I read this just after telling her good night.

The third hour of being twenty-four, I screamed in despair as I found out that the manga series above ended in a cliffhanger. They did finish the story of getting revenge on their cheating girlfriend/boyfriend though, but they did not end up together (not yet, at least). It's actually so fucking over.

The fourth hour until the eleventh hour of being twenty-four, I was sleeping.

The twelfth hour of being twenty-four, I woke up and lounge around, and was serenaded with birthday song from my mom and my sister. It was peaceful.

The thirteenth hour of being twenty-four, I lounge around some more while waiting for my sister to finish showering, before showering myself.

The fourteenth hour of being twenty-four, I dropped off my sister near a mall, and zoomed off towards my university, in my leather jacket. Sweltering heat makes me feel like my skin is cooked, this jacket is a mistake.

The fifteenth hour of being twenty-four, I spend it on a library, trying to study in my desperate last hour attempt, but fails to do so.

The sixteenth hour of being twenty-four, I was furiously scribbling my answer to the exam for the course of Advanced Accounting, having no idea what to write for the first hour.

The seventeenth hour of being twenty-four, I resigned myself to fate and decided to wing it, putting down my guesses as for what the answer might be for these two cases (A case about translating financial reports to a foreign currency and a case about a company hedging their gold) and went on my merry way.

The eighteenth hour of being twenty-four, my friend pulled me to hang out with them, with the promise of having something helpful for the exam tomorrow. We ate in peace, and me and one of my friend moved away to the next place, an ice cream bar, to hang out some more while we wait for said "helpful things" to show. I was waiting peacefully, but then was surprised when my friend came in with a red velvet cake. They were actually planning this, probably last minute. I... uhh... I felt full. I haven't been surprised like this in a while. This feels nice. In other news, I was offered something of a job. It was a great start to being 24.

The nineteenth hour of being twenty-four, I spend it hanging out with my friends, talking about the exam tomorrow, while also speedrunning through a task that has a vague deadline of tomorrow, which involves using Stata and compiling data from .csv files. I continued my correspondence with my friend who offered me the job.

The twentieth hour of being twenty-four. My mom phoned me at this hour, checking to see where I went because we actually have a dinner planned. I completely forgot due to all the shenanigans that I was pulled in, and apologized. We continued hanging out and grinding for the assignment.

The twenty-first hour of being twenty-four. We are still grinding on the assignment, with less horsing around as we fully focused on it. I continued corresponding with my friend who offered me a job, and I was messaged by another person about wiki stuff. I am *very* swamped.

The twenty-second hour of being twenty-four. We finished the massive portion of the task, and decided to go home. I thanked everyone for the surprise.

The twenty-third hour of being twenty-four. I zoomed back on my motorcycle towards my home. The leather jacket actually feels nice now, I don't feel chilly at all as it blocks everything. I got home and immediately showered, but not before my mom gave me another gift, a yellow mug. It looks really cool.

The twenty-fourth hour of being twenty-four. I spend it on my PC and Laptop as I helped my friends finish the assignment, and it lasts well into the next day.
