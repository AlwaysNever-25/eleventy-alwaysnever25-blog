I played the AMQ match today, and it was... exhilirating. I was unable to go to sleep from yesterday, even though I came home near midnight, because I spent the hours training with someone I know on Discord, for AMQ. Honestly, I feel like without those extra time practicing, I would've been cooked in the match.

Not like I wasn't already cooked in the match...

Yeah, I lost. Well, it's not a complete shutout of a game though. For this match, which is determined after playing two games, we should try playing both multiple choice and typing games, one game each.

For the multiple choice, I tried so hard to win against my enemy. Multiple choice was basically my forte, so to speak, but some mistakes on my end, and my enemy's honestly baffling choice of anime on his list managed to take me off the running. I lost the game, 18-16.

Coming in on the typing game, I was honestly hopeless. Typing game is my actual weakness, aside of Jojo's OPs, so I thought I would probably get beaten up easily here. But after we both fumbled on easy songs here and there, I realized that my enemy is also not as good in typing games. I smell a chance. I play for the win, at some point winning over by one point, but at the end, I blundered twice... and I wasn't able to get the dub. I lost the game, and the match, 15-13.

It was a really close game, though. I feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins throughout the match, and got my enemy to admit that I didn't make it easy for him (it was really close, I could have beaten him at some point). But he ended up winning in the end, there's no debating that. That's the end of my journey for the AMQ tournament. Next year, I'll come back stronger...

Finished Volume 11 of *Imosae* today. I don't really feel good about the story, and not because it's bad or anything. Objectively, it's another peak coming from the series, but the events on the volume made me confront the possible truth that I might face similar situation in the future, and even though-

Lost my train of thought, so I won't continue them.
