I finally begun my binge of stuff that I completely stalled last season, starting with the breakout series *Solo Leveling*. I should've stopped at episode 4 actually, because it perfectly segmented itself by changing Jinwoo's appearance by episode 5 to his pre-Shadow Monarch look...

I'd say, the adaptation so far is mixing both the familiar manhwa style, with its own action animation, and also a bit more lore than what the manhwa gives. I cannot remember for the life of me if they take those lore tidbits straight from the novel or not, but if they do, they're very based for that. It makes the world feel more than just Jinwoo and the power trip fantasy, exactly what the novel has too.

I somehow missed that this season has *Sasayaku You ni Koi wo Utau*, and rushed over to watch this- holy fucking shit Himari is so... so cute. Yori is so cool... it's peak... RRAAAAHHHHHH

This season also has *Sentai Daishikkaku*, or *Ranger Reject*. I'll probably shelf this as a binge when the season is over, because I need to focus on finishing my stalled list. *Solo Leveling* alone will take a few days, and I still have more in my list... and my break will be over by Day 111...
