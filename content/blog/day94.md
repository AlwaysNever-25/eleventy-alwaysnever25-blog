There's extension for the contracts, but my chances are still slim, unless I play *Darkest Dungeon* for at least 20 hours straight. I ain't gonna lie, that doesn't sound possible. There's also *The Letter* that I haven't finished, and all the reviews... I don't know anymore.

Okay, it's not as hopeless as I thought it'd be. Well, Darkest Dungeon can still fuck me up, but I am progressing with speed for *The Letter*. I finished Chapter 1-3 by the time I'm writing this! It's about almost halfway there, but the major roadblock remains. Chapter 4 is underway, and the last three chapters are by far the longest out of all of them.
