First day back to college, it's like I never left.

I have to learn about macroeconomics term today, which was a bit interesting.

I'm also close to finish my secret santa gift, deadline tonight. But it turns out, even my friend, the person running the event, has not finished his gift yet, so he give me some lee way to finish it a bit late. We're both deadliners like this...

I'm also continuing my training for AMQ, listening to a lot of openings. One of these days I'm going to actually watch these anime...

Selen got dismissed today from Nijisanji, and there's a lot of shit storm that ensues from this. I already felt like this is coming, since she hasn't streamed in a while. It's not like I follow her religiously, but the news of her announcing that she was taken to the hospital was everywhere, back in December. She never returned after that fiasco with the Last Cup of Coffee cover (I managed to get the video downloaded too, as someone who adores the shit out of the original by LilyPichu).

Today is MONDAY, and so the return of Dungeon and Dragons is upon us, as I delve back into the role of Krir, the Tortle. I haven't really told you guys about this because the game was actually suspended throughout the month of January (final exam for all of us), and we didn't manage to start early enough (I was being a bit of a dumb dumb last week and fooled the DM into thinking I'm offline when I was just invisible). 

The story so far, we were brought together through contrived "fate" as everyone witnessed the death of *my* character (yes, this tortle died cause he's a dumb dumb, jumping off a tree with his shell first hitting an anvil trying to break it, but instead both the anvil and his shell breaks and he fucking DIES). 

As shenanigan happens in the realm of Death (he used to be human), I was entrusted to lure out his brother, a trickster of sorts, so that Death can finally kill him. I was revived by Death, and was tasked to retrieve the artifact that this trickster has, owned by the village elder. It is now currently in my person.

Now we travel as a party towards a library on the island that we're in, that contains information regarding this "brother" of Death. We spent a session on logistics, and some off the cuff scam attempts. There's also one time we wandered into the forest and saved a mountain lion(?) from hunters trying to hunt it.

This session starts off as we continue our journey, still in the middle of reaching that town with the library in it. There are some stuff regarding mushroom that I basically tune out of (I don't want to impose, it seems like they're having fun and I was actually occupied with AMQ prep and other stuff), but then after the journey continues, we were faced with a goblin invasion on a town. We successfully managed to get the first wave of goblin, but their boss, a massive green creature, shows up at the end, and that's how the session ends for the night, as the electricity in my house dips out just as it ends before midnight.
