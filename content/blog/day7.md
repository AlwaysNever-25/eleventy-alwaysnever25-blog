I was busy the whole day, driving for my aunt's family to buy some things, and I was back by 5pm.

Watched The Prestige by nightfall. I'll just let my letterboxd review say it all.

The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The movie starts itself by telling us its structure, 
framing it as the way magic acts work, and the whole narrative adheres to the structure down to the tee. 
The movie managed to reveal the Pledge, Turn, and Prestige of the story perfectly, as it delves deep 
into two rival magicians whose life interconnects with each other through magic acts, deaths, and 
the allure of delivering the perfect Prestige.
