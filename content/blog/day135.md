*Charlotte* groupwatch continues as we get into the meat of the story. The literal meat. We get bombshells after bombshells packed within the eighth, ninth, and tenth episode. All started after our MC Yuu meet up with the ZHIEND blind vocalist Sala. It then barrels forward into a date, mental breakdown, an alternate timeline story, and a missing brother. Insane development over the past three episodes. I don't even know how they will manage with the last three episodes, but it has to be something wild if this is only the road to the climax.

-----

I finally finished *Imosae* anime, and as the ending comes I feel something akin to a solemn bliss. I wrote a bit about what I feel on Anilist, so I'll just paste them here to save time:

> The anime adapted parts that they decided to adapt well, the way the novel is structured makes it really easy for them to pick their strengths instead of adapting the whole thing, and it shows here in the anime. The moments from the novel they decided to put in are crafted well, and it feels like it's a single continuity. It doesn't feel rushed nor have gaps, and goddammit they make all the characters sound cooler and cuter! Itsuki, Haruto, heck even Toki feels cooler! And don't even mention Miyako, Ashley, and Kaiko... the standout of course has to go to Nayuta for shattering what I thought of her voice when I read the novels. I had no idea what I thought her voice would sound like, but it's definitely not what the anime has, and I think it's better this way cause she's supposed to be this younger girl, but still not the youngest (and Chihiro sounds even more mature than her, how is this possible...). All this only makes me sad that I can't get to hear her talk during the era when she cuts her hair short if you get what I mean. The juxtaposition of that compared to this part of her life would be insane to watch...

> Anyway, I'd say this is at least an 8/10, can't be too high because as much as I want to give it one, it is limited by the fact that it's only 12 episodes. Should be more, but perhaps if they were given more episode, it might not be as good as this... a dilemma indeed.

The things I can add to this is that this is perhaps a successful example of an anime that are explicitly made to be an advertisement to the source, instead of something that they plan to be made into a successful franchise... but goddammit I still want to see Nayuta with a short hair talk... or certain characters in the novels come to life... Nadeshiko...

*Henjin no Salad Bowl* continues their switch-up of protagonist by once again focusing on the bodyguard/homeless woman Livia, and her journey to live independently. This time, she was approached by her fan/cult leader Noa and turn herself into a mooch, which she was not happy about. A chance encounter with Puriketsu (not the same Puriketsu as *Imosae*) however creates the possibility that the three of them combines their strength to create a band. This series hasn't let me down in all the twisting turns the life of this reverse isekaied character turn out to be. I can't wait to see how this all will resolve, or how far would the anime bring itself before I decided to just read the LN.

*Spice and Wolf* continues from the ending of the fifth episode with both Holo and Lawrence on the run in the sewer, but things turn for the worse as they get circled around by the baddies, the rival merchant, I don't want to remember their name but they have his buddy, from the village Holo hails from where he trades wheats, on their side. Cue some dramatic moments, and Holo turning into a giant wolf. Honestly, the ending really made me think Holo went off on her own because she saw Lawrence being scared of what she did, but I was happy at the end there that she is still there waiting for him, wanting to continue their journey, with a flimsy reason. 

Heed the wolf's call, see her for yourself here:

Because of the delay in our groupwatch, we watched the sixth episode really close to the release of the seventh, and decided to watch it as well because we might not be as free as we are this week, and the story takes off with Holo and Lawrence basically just go on a fucking date, holy shit they're so wholesome, take a look at Holo as a country girl here, with all her majesty:

We also see a possible new antagonist... or perhaps love rival?

Needless to say, Holo is not amused. How will this develop? This is getting exciting!
