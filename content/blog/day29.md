Spent the day on my dad's office, moving and fixing his PC and whatnot. Reminds me of a time when I became that, back when I was still green. Now I feel older and still incompetent, cause I cannot for the life of me figure out why these PC cannot interact with each other anymore like they used to be, even though they already have ethernet cable plugged. I hate this...

Also read *Kyou mo Veranda de*, at least catching up to it. I feel like I'm learning a lot about gardening, but also the romance between the main couple are pretty cute. An actress and a graphic designer who has gardens on his veranda... I'm awaiting for the continuation of their journey.

I also wrote some summaries on *Kaguya-sama* wiki. It's been a while since I do an actual "legwork" in wiki I frequent on visiting. I don't usually visit *Kaguya-sama* wiki actually, but they are closely tied to the *Oshi no Ko* wiki that I ran. So I feel compelled to check sometimes, and today, I feel like contributing.
