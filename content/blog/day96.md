Slept really early yesterday... my stomach was not cooperating with me. I had Tomb Raider boot up ready to be finished last night, too, but ended up having to finish it after midnight instead when I woke up... while having bouts of really bad diarrhea.

Honestly, it was surprising that I was able to finish *Rise of the Tomb Raider* in that time. The game, especially after I get the Triple Shot + True Shot, is really fun! I love using the bows, and how these two skills made it viable to go through the later parts of the game where they throw you like waves of enemies, it really helps.

After I finished the game basically five hours before the deadline, I decided that I will not make a fancy review for any of these contracts except *Magus of the Library*, which was already in production before everything else. So I get to write a few paragraphs about the game I just finished, about *Non Non Biyori*, and posted the link to my *Magus* review, now with embed links! Working on the beer page really improved my skills a bit (need to learn how to modernize it though).

I also made the decision not to go to class, because I really feel like I would shit my pants on the way to uni. This give me ample time to get my ass through *The Letter*, which proves to be an arduous task to beat since Chapter 6 is incredibly long. It was basically the climax of the whole story though, on the POV of the guy with the highest chance to die if we picked the wrong option from other chapters.

Looking at the Visual Novel structure ("branching path" in-game) was enough to give me headache, especially considering the programming side of this. I gained more and more respect for those who make a living from creating games. Anyway, I managed to finish *The Letter* about 30 minutes before deadline, and I spent the last 30 minutes basically scrambling to finish both the review a

After the rush is over, I turned my focus on getting *Darkest Dungeon* before April 8th came, the deadline where if I fail, I might not be able to join the next season.

I already know that I'll probably be too busy to join next season anyway, but I still want to try and get this game done anyway. But... as I research more and more about the game, I get this despairing sense that I will not even get close to finishing this game.

This game is incredibly punishing, and even if I spent the whole 72 hours on this game (impossible to do anyway, I need to shave off 30 hours for sleep, and I have things to do in those days, which cut even more hours into those), if I get incredibly unlucky, it won't even matter.

I do still try though. Fingers crossed...
