Final exam... kinda did okay with it? but there's still a chance I'll fail this one...

Even though this is the final Final exam, I don't really feel free yet...

<summary>Gacha stuff (NIKKE, ZZZ)</summary>

NIKKE's *Beauty Full Shot* is from the outside, an obvious summer waifu bait story where they forced two characters that were known for their criminal activity to perform as a swimsuit model, but as I go through the story itself, I find myself enjoying the interactions that this combination bring, since they're not the only two that came with us. 

A whole entourage of people, including our regular team, the Counters, wearing their own swimsuit (they're the past characters that got their own swimsuit alters). A doctor that does not open her eyes (that also has her own swimsuit alter). A rehabilitated criminal wearing specialized handcuffs that can best be described as a not-green she-hulk (she got her own swimsuit skin). This criminal's bodyguard (she also got her own swimsuit skin). And a pair of criminal that just sneaked in to be with them at this point (honestly, why is Viper and Jackal with them again?).

The whole thing shouldn't work. It really shouldn't. But I find myself captivated as they all started loosening up and have fun, vibing the summer vibes. I'm kinda speechless, the last time a summer event got me this invested was 'Ideal City' on Arknights. This evoke similar feeling... and also Gavial alter is as sexy as Sakura alter, that's for sure-

Anyway, the story really focuses on the pairing of us self-insert MC and Sakura... and oh boy, they do not hold back, some of these scenes got me *blushing* real hard. Like... my god, this character supposedly has many partners in the Ark where he belong, don't get me start hoping that he can be with Sakura as the endgame reeeee
