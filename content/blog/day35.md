After Oppenheimer watching before midnight, we decided to do an impromptu viewing of *Jojo Rabbit*, Taika Waititi's film that touches upon a sensitive topic about young German boy during WWII.

It was honestly... a whiplash of a movie. I was uncomfortable with the clash of vibes between the happy go lucky imagination of the boy, and the horror that is living in Germany during WWII. The idyllic tone sometimes cut into a horrifying look at how they treat traitors during the day, gallows... I am not even sure I want to describe.

The whole day after that is a bit aimless, until I found out that I need to rush to finish some of the Honkai: Star Rail's limited time event before it goes away. I decided to do them, while also finishing the last of the Foxian Haunted questline. I'll finish them fully later. I also did Argenti's companion mission, which was somehow strangely poetic, considering the person involved. I can't wait for this stubborn bastard to crash into Penacony somehow.

After that's done, I decided to get a bit serious with my AMQ stuff, and make a playlist to study. This playlist contains openings of anime included in the mandatory anime list that we need to include while playing against each other. All of the anime included in the list is related to the servers affiliated with the anicord, which at this point is *numerous*.

I also accelerate the progress for my secret santa gift. It's supposed to be on deadline tomorrow, and I'm still not yet close to done.

And with that, I return to class tomorrow. *Sigh...*
