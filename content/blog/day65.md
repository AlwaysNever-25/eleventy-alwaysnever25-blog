Today's class is concerning CSS, where we learn about how to create navigation bar that drops down, and responsive CSS, which I slept through because I'm feeling a bit under the weather...

But that doesn't stop my mom from asking me to go on an errand... okay.

It also doesn't stop me from FINALLY FINISHING TOMB RAIDER. Or at least, progressing until the very last chapter where the game clearly points out it's a point of no return.

At that point I was so tired I'm considering sleeping and do it tomorrow, but I think I might persevere...
