Class supposed to happen today, but once again, it was cancelled, and this time I wasn't the only one who got hoodwinked. The entire class body didn't realize it was cancelled, so we were all there waiting for the professor to came, until someone pointed out that the class is cancelled.

Well, this is just great.

I just spent the free time with my classmates singing in a karaoke place, and goes home afterwards. Nothing more I can say.

Well... except that I didn't progress at all in any of my contracts today. I slowly starting to think that laying all the plans down make me unwilling to go through it... maybe I should've kept it vague...

Anyway, I finally wrote a full review on Imosae on my anilist! For the past few days as well, I've been steadily working my way on the wiki, improving on the main series page, and the character pages as well. Adding templates to help with my work... yadda yadda boring wiki stuff. I'll just copy paste below what I have in mind for volume 14 in my anilist review:

finished volume 14, and with this, I finished the series as a whole. (This was a few days late because I was a bit busy with something else and I wanted to wait until I was a bit more free).

Because this is the review of the final volume, and my feelings about it, this time the review will be filled with SPOILERS. I beg you, if we have a good rapport with each other, I'm ready to lose it all now.

Please, consider reading the series.

If you hate the parts that are a bit... sus, or rather very degenerate, feel free to SKIP IT. I don't usually endorse this, but I had to do so at the start for a few of the parts. If you'd rather spend your money on something not suspicious at all, well, not like I am condoning a crime, but there are ways you can do that without spending any money.

You might think that means this series is unreadable, but part of why it is so good is that you get to see the journey of losing that degeneracy slowly and methodically. By the time he starts to become someone more worthy to be called a protagonist, it's like you're looking at your own baby, your own child, finally growing up to be someone you can be proud of. I promise you, you won't regret it.

SPOILERS BEGIN FROM THIS PART. DON'T RAGE AT ME IF YOU GET SPOILED FROM NOW ON.

*"Bring it on!"*

With the last goading by our goat Itsuki Hashima, I find myself inspired. I was inspired to become someone in the story of my own life. A protagonist. But hang on, before I get to what I feel at the end of this magnificent series, let's take a look at how the story goes in the final volume.

After the insane cliffhanger that the writer just dropped on us at the last volume, three years later bring a TON of changes to the cast. Itsuki is in the place where he has been wishing for years, the spotlight, standing side to side with her beloved and rival whom he has a kid now, and using her real name as well, Kazuko Hashima.

We see Miyako, growing to become the fearless editor, dubbed "Lady Pirate of Branch Hill" due to her unintentionally grabbing writers from other publishing companies XD. Honestly, that part where they have this tense Christmas Party, ending up with Shirogamine (Miyako's boss) and Godo (Miyako's old boss) basically talking about the state of the publishing company in a heated but civil argument... one of the funniest thing I've ever read in this series.

Haruto is now on the upswing of things, with his Leviathan Revive series adapted to a successful anime with a second season incoming, he's now becoming a veteran in the industry and a respectable name... and he is still waiting for Miyako as well. Good god, even Chihiro's pissed at the state of things, and that girl is trying REALLY hard during the time skip, too! The throwaway line of what she did made my jaw DROP. She did what?!

Anyway, speaking of Chihiro... she now has long hair and honestly, if you tell me this is someone else, I would have believed you. She looks mature, and more like an onee-san now compared to before, and a lot more boisterous and reminds me of Itsuki the longer she goes on. They really are siblings, especially in the way they set up that date for Miyako and Haruto...

We also get tiny updates on everybody else, including Aoba (my god her change was...), Ui Aioi (she is now fully adopting the Bocchi getup), Nadeshiko (wearing a goth-lolita outfit and writing vampire fanfic.. oh, how she has fallen), Makina and Ashley (now mom friends and dad friends with Kazuko and Itsuki, their children playdate all the time with their aunt of the same age, Shiori).

And didja know Kaiko has a fucking girlfriend what in the fuck that's so cute????? (We don't talk about how she used to be her assistant, I've read Bakuman, and I know that can happen)

One of the biggest surprises I had was Setsuna returning again from slumber after he took a step back for the drama to occur in the world... the author really made me think that he's changed and made him look all cool all of a sudden... but he's still an ass chaser, and he might be aiming to actually date Chihiro at this point to... see her ass... I can't even defend him even if I'm his lawyer...

Anyway, that's pretty much everyone in this volume. It's really crazy to see how life changes after just a mere three years for everyone, but it really highlights their journey throughout their series, their struggles, their burning desire to fight on, and be their own... protagonist in their own story.

I repeated that a lot, didn't I? But it's a core part of why this story works for me, why it inspires me. Coming in, I already know what Itsuki meant by everyone being a protagonist of their own story. Every day, I look at random people and sometimes I wonder, "They have their own circumstances, unique problems, situations that can be considered a story on their own."

But not until reading this story that I realized that I haven't looked at my own life as that.

I've been looking at them as if I'm some kind of observer, a reader if you must say, detached from the world like all my actions wouldn't matter. It reflects in all the choices I've made so far in life, or at least the choices I've made until some point years ago. It's something that I do to keep my life going, to let it guide me, to let someone else write the story, ride on the passion of others so that I don't have to be passionate myself.

I'm not gonna say that this series is what changes things for me. I've already had an epiphany about this more than a year ago, but instead, after reading this series, I feel like I'm adding another perspective to that life I have seen. I've been... infected by the raw passion radiating from a fictional character, his actions scream egoism to me at first, but sometimes you do need to be one to have the life that you want. He directly refers to ME specifically when he asked this question.

*"If you read a novel that starred you as a protagonist, would you be able to enjoy the story?"*

I won't. Not yet.

*"Because if you don't think you could... then I think you need to change. Or, really, I think you're wishing you can change."*

I do wish to change. I wish it with all my heart. This series might not be the first thing that kicks me into changing, but it damn sure gonna stay in my heart and boost me up until I do change. And even after I'm changed...

*"I think I'm gonna continue to change, and I think that may result in disappointing some of you over time. (...) But I'm no longer afraid of change."*

I'm no longer scared of change, not as much.

*"I regret nothing about the path I traveled..."*

I want to forge my own path and look back, saying this exact same thing.

*"I'm right here, everyone!"*

I want to be able to say this as I stake my claim on this world, proving that I exist. The enormous challenge that might come with that will be hard to bear, but to that I say, and to end this review...

*"Bring it on!"*
