Nailed the exam today. The last two. The first one is a standard, just wing it exam, focusing a lot about management stuff. I think I might scrape by with a 70. The last one though... now that's a doozy. That's like, the hardest exam out of all of them.

I had to spend hours before the exam studying with my friends, writing our own notes (that we ended up not using on the exam itself as help but only to study on our own), and still I feel jittery when I get to sit on the class for the exam. I was so worried that I'll blew this. This exam is one of the exam that I cannot skimp by, because I got a particularly bad grade for this course's midterm exam, so I have to really try here.

I feel like I do nail them, writing for every single question with a somewhat correct answer. My calculations are way off though for some of them, but I feel like I'll be docked only a few points for those. I'm thinking that I should be passing this course as well, which is great. I do not want to delay my graduation even more.
