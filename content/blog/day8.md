*Magus of the Library* is a 10/10. I'll put in my thoughts here even though this is supposed to be a contract, which should be put on my contract review portion of the website, but I'll put it here nonetheless for future references. I have grand ideas about how I want to pour my love for this series, because it was a magnificent story.

Every chapter of the manga is very dense, 60-80 pages. It doesn't get translated monthly, we have to wait until whenever the english volume is out for me to continue the story, but goddamn the story itself is so good.

The art is approaching the level of greatness that *Witch Hat Atelier* does. Worldbuilding rivals western novels, and it is very appropriate because the story itself concerns books and libraries, so they make sure to really give you a proper world for you to understand.

The characters... man, the characters themselves are peak as well. They're all thirteen years old and varied, yet I can't help but already root for them ***ALL***, that's right, even the designated character that you're not supposed to like yet. Their design are articulate, based on the fictional races which I now know is based on real life.

History of this world is layered, intrigue surrounding the power system is tight, I can talk a lot about it, but I'll keep it in until I finally properly reached the end of the current chapters. I only read 20/29 chapters currently out, and I'm already thinking that this is a 10/10 manga.

Anyway... now that is out of the way, I'll update you on some things. I finally finished *Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu* anime! It was fluffy up until the last second, and I can't wait to watch the first episode of season 2 as well, but now that I finished this, it became one of many animes this season I'm watching weekly.

    - Frieren cour 2
    - Solo Leveling
    - Mato Seihei no Slave
    - Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu
    
This won't be all I'm watching this season though, just the one that is airing. My plans for this season, and probably would be for the rest of the year, is to finish off my planned to watch/planned to read list. For PTW, it includes, in order of personal importance:

    - Zom 100 (last three ep)
    - Dead Mount Death Play (both part)
    - 100gf (6/12)
    - CSM (4/12)
    - SxF season 2
    - My Dress Up Darling (2/12)
    - 86 (both part)
    - Komi (both season)
    - Scott Pilgrim Takes Off
    - Belle (movie)
    
This list will change as I usually don't adhere to a strict list, especially those written down, but instead will impulsively do whatever I want. I really need to fix this, or control it somewhat...

Also, I actually didn't talk about this before but I've been reading mangas as well during these one week, including *Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu* (which I managed to read up to chapter 100 before starting). Today, I was able to finish off *Watari-kun no xx ga Houkai Sunzen*, which just ended and revealed that it would have an anime adaptation of, probably meaning it'll air sometime this year or early next year. I'll let my Anilist comment on the series be my comment as a whole about the series.

barring two extra chapters, this is basically finished for now. the manga is... very dramatic, 
and not in a good way either. 
by the end, I didn't feel as good even after everyone reached their happy ending in a way, 
I can't really pinpoint my problem with it though.
...okay I'll elaborate. The thing is, this manga is a romance, a typical triangle between a childhood friend and a prim and proper girlfriend. There was no doubt about it that I was behind Satsuki being the winner, but the way they go about it is pretty... weird. Convoluted? I don't know if it's because of the scanlation that I was served on, but the story just became something I can't get myself invested on...

Well, with that out of the way, Ishihara (the other girl who loses) gets a goddamn makeover after her heart gets broken, and now I don't know who I fucking like anymore... I mean... she wore a CHOKER... it's my weakness...

And lastly, there's some update regarding stories that I put on this website as well. Remember Stickverse? I 'member. It was dormant for two years because I don't feel like going back to it, but now that a stray thought came over me, I reviewed a story that I wrote on my google notes, basically the original 'Shadows' story in my language, and I feel like translating it properly this time.

The first chapter that I put up on this website is a shoddy work at trying to translate it. I prefer the way I did mine in the original language, it flows better... but I have a nagging feeling that it's because I wrote it in a language I was more comfortable in, and it will lose a lot of its flavor trying to translate it to English.
