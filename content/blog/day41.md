Penacony is PEAK. Firefly, a character that I know through leaks and didn't really pay attention to, and started paying attention to after that 'White Night' trailer, is someone that I would die for, literally. I know the rumor and the leaks regarding her fate, so I'm much, much more prepared than usual... but seriously, I will KILL the person responsible for her fate if it does become true.
