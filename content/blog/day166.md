So... for the past two weeks, I've been pretty neglectful of this daily project, dare I say. It reminds me of that time when Two Thousand Twenty Project started winding down as I started missing weeks of writing... but back then, it's mostly because I was kinda out of it. This time, it's different... I'm kinda being all over the place, having to handle fires and people wanting my time, and it all just ended up like this. I don't even get to watch or read stuff recently, except some groupwatches... I'll write about them in the appropriate days.

Anyway... Hi. I'm writing this from my PC that I evacuated to my parent's room, cause my room's walls are repainted right now, and I can't sleep there because paint fumes obviously. My mom half-jokingly ask me to just stay here for the whole week, which would mean that I would have to... uhh... hold myself off for a week. Should be doable, but I hate that I'm stalling yet another VN that I started...
