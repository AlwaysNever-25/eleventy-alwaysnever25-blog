I just want to sleep a lot, and I understand that's a red flag for something I'm fighting returning back to my face. The pit. Me deciding to cut myself off from things I loved also didn't help.

A sudden family trip again kinda depresses me, and they say they're going to do this weekly for this month.

I don't have energy to rage for this...

A story about a mother and her son who cannot have the same level of emotion at the same time, always diametrically opposed.
