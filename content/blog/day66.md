I persevered! Finished Tomb Raider (2013) with 98% completion... missing a few challenges that honestly is a pain to track down. But I did get all the relics, GPS Cache, and documents! Basically all the collectibles... that actually provide some good lore for the game... I like these kinds of collectible. It's optional still, but if you do get it, you'd understand the full picture of what is happening. Not like you don't get it from just the actual story though, it just... enriches them, you get me?

I didn't waste any time though, I am WAAYYYY behind on my schedule, so I immediately dived into Rise of the Tomb Raider. I noticed the graphics option has DLSS this time...

Oh, wow. I can actually get crisp graphics now... when I first played the cutscene, using my XBox controller... I really feel like, finally, I've become a gamer. :')

The cutscenes alone from the Rise of the Tomb Raider is *top notch*, and the quality didn't seem to dip during the gameplay either??? That has been one of the selling point for Tomb Raider (2013) for me as well, how seamless they are in applying cutscenes to gameplay. For the longest time, I only can see this thing being played by others instead of playing it myself, as a Let's Play of some sorts. But now that I can play it myself...

First of all, I get it now when people prefer controller over PC. In terms of being immersed, controller does offer you some kind of edge... especially because of the rumble. This takes me back... the last time I have played games that has that was the Wii, which has been almost a decade now... The rumble is not a big feature that people would laud over, but for me, that makes a lot of difference.

There's also the camera movement using the stick, a slow movement compared to using mouse that you can basically flick over. It makes the game, specifically this one though, feel more cinematic, which was definitely the main features of this game. It's like a very lengthy movie where you can basically control the characters. This type of game is critically acclaimed for a reason, after all.

Anyway, back to Rise of the Tomb Raider...

Just from the first few levels alone, it's already a step up to Tomb Raider for me. I am, however, a bit apprehensive about picking basically the hardest difficulty for this game. Looking at this, this means I'm not gonna finish this in the time I set for myself... which means I might have to play the other games in my free time, to see if I can chip in some progress whilst I focus on Rise of Tomb Raider when I'm free for a longer period of time.

I also need to progress through all the non-game contracts... at this point, they're easier to finish than the game. I'm confident I can finish them all today, if not this week. Today was supposed to be a free day, as well, but I had to take my sister to her uni, and I'm writing this now in a nearest cafe whilst waiting for her...

Maybe I should read Magus of the Library and Your Throne while I wait...
