A rose bloom in the deep dark underground, unperturbed by the condition of its life. It shines with a bright red color, and it grew as time passes. The rose were helped by the stalactite, her anchor and rock (literally). She was also helped by the sun, the light of its life, who brought her sustenance aside of water.

There is nothing of the life on the ground above her that the rose knew. For all its life, it only knew of the sun and the rock.

Suppose we can personify this rose as a little girl, and the rock as another creature. The sun is an angel, descending down from the heaven.

Just had this thought while coming back from class, thinking that it'd be a grim story where turns out the angel are keeping the rose there on purpose and been manipulating her to stay underground. Inspired by the story "The Girl Who Looked Up", portion of Bam's story from "Tower of God", and like, potentially other story with these setup that I unknowingly read and form this idea from.

Went to *Star Rail Carnival* yesterday... with friends! Bought a card holder and won a free holographic ticket. Thinking about going back to it tomorrow to see if it's possible to get more free merch... maybe try to get a holographic Stelle card...
