Woke up with a fever today, even though I have a make up class to go to. Decided to stay home.

Burned up a bit at noon, had some weird dreams. Always had those when I'm sick, but yeah. Stuck in bed for the most part of the day. Read up some manga, no progress on games. Still not reading my contract. I should get on that.

Having trouble eating, but ended up eating a bit. Opened up some anime to soothe myself. Finally started Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu anime, hopefully able to finish the season before the season 2 drops on day 7.

Also watched Mato Seihei no Slave anime. It looks low-budget, but I'll be there until the end, for all the "rewards" scene. They don't skimp out on those... but they do skimp on the actual action scenes though. Shame.

Didn't put this in yesterday but I managed to finish the second season of Arknights anime, or we can say Arknights: Perish in Frost for the full name. FrostNova part still got me, even now. Glad that the anime at least able to do that for me, and glad that I have another anime under my belt.

My process of culturing myself starting to bear fruit. Nothing else to report other than that.
