So... exam today. I was completely unprepared, of course. Had to study the night before, sleeping by 4 AM, for exam scheduled at 8 AM. I haven't printed any of my notes for the exam when I wake up at 6 AM. Had to make a decision to print near my university, or I'll be late. 

Ended up to be a wise decision, cause I arrive at my uni basically 10 minutes before. Panicking, I had to find an available print shop. Nearest one is about three minutes ride from my uni.

Turns out I don't have all the notes I needed, specifically some tables (T distribution, Z distribution, F distribution). I had to beg a friend to send me her file, and she came through.

I had to wait in a queue in the shop. I was late, 10 minutes late thankfully. They allow me in (I have been late for more before).

Exam was pretty chill. I understand what they were asking, and one of my notes... well, they have the answer for the exam. It's not 1:1 answer though, but it basically laid out all the necessary steps for me to find the answer.

Still, I didn't fully finish them all. It take sooooo much time to decipher the steps, I didn't even have time to finish them all. I'm confident that I'll get at least a passing grade for this one, though.
