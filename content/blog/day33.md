I finally decided to read ten more chapters of *Your Throne*. It's a pretty heavy chapter... I usually would be able to binge them, but I find that in such heavy series, it's the matter of mood and how it might dissipate when you are interrupted.

I finished volume 9 of *Imosae*, and wrote a bit of my thoughts on it on anilist:

Finished volume 9 earlier this morning. having TWO characters becoming Itsuki's "little sister" as a catalyst for Chihiro finally blowing up and saying that she is his actual little sister... one of them is an adorable one too... and the other is an older sister who really wanted to have a big brother... damn. this volume is too cute-

But with such cuteness, an equal force must come to bring balance, and it comes with the portion about Miyako's job hunt... as a person who's really close to doing that right now, and perhaps should be looking for a job right now, that part about her finding her true purpose was something I can relate. I had an epiphany about the same thing for myself two years ago, pretty sure the same age Miyako has hers, or slightly older, but yeah... that part is sobering and inspiring, and also despair-inducing.

Also, Itsuki's anime finally airs! it was such a relief to see that it didn't become crap, even after all the alterations he made to it to accommodate the landscape. I got the feeling that most of the experiences Itsuki faced are something Yomi Hirasaka faced adapting this very series, if not his previous series Haganai. The struggle to produce such things was very inspiring and very harsh from my point of view. Knowing how hard he tried, while there is news recently about a mangaka author trying to fix up the screenplay for the adaptation of their work but ended up not succeeding.. and their eventual tragic suicide... it's a pretty hard world out there for creatives, huh?

Made me wonder if I had known this series earlier, when I was 19, just as young as Nayuta was... would this change my mind about writing? Would I have tried doing something else during the pandemic? Maybe I could have a different path right now.

Another volume, another layer of cuteness like frosting, hiding the inner depth like that of a cake, and with little fillings of inspiration here and there.

PewDiePie released a video where he drawn for 100 days straight... sounding a bit familiar to my project- I'm just kidding. I'm glad to see the person I've watched for years breaking new ground, and holy shit this guy improved so fast. I can feel how proud he is too looking at how fast he improved after he reached a certain days. It reminds me of the feeling I get reading my old writing, thinking that I have improved now as well. Not that much, but I'm slightly better now. ~~Not because I use Grammarly now~~

Reading back on my projects again... I used to sound so much like I'm in love. Where has that love gone? It's like the quote I give to my best friend,

> "It's like looking at a cleaner reflection of myself in the water when you clearly know you're caked in dirt."

I also wrote summaries for *Oshi no Ko* wiki today, for chapter 77 and 96. Reading the chapter intimately gets me to feel a bit more for Ruby and Akane more than what I have in mind.

I also started playing Osu again today... well, it's actually been a few days, since day 29. But today... I managed to listen to some banger OP like *Jiyuu no Tsubasa* (AoT OP 2), *Kanashii Ureshii* (Koi to Uso OP), and non-OP song like *Yoiyoi Kokon* by REOL. I'm slowly culturing myself...

In fact, playing Osu for a bit made me ignore my friends calling for me to join them in the groupwatch for the masterpiece *Tenet*, released in the wrong time. 2020-2021 was not a great time for cinemas, and if this was released at any time, I'll believe that this would be a smash hit. 

Even though people hated it for being too up its own ass for them to understand, I enjoyed it solely for its attempt to make a unique movie, just like *Inception* before it, and the classic *Memento*. I'm glad to find out that one of my friend also enjoys Tenet in the same way that I do, because in all these paradoxes that it creates, the heart of the story is there, and once that last scene in the movie plays out...

My heart still can't bear it.

Also, did you know that the illustrious *Ludwig GÃ¶ransson* composed the soundtrack for this, and it is *bombastic*. Like, holy fucking shit, it's permeating throughout the movie, it punches you with emotion. I can say a lot about the soundtrack because honestly it's literally half of the reason why I love the movies, other than the emotional heart in the core of the story.

The core that remains even though the Protagonist's name is the Protagonist. Yeah, I don't mind people hating on this, honestly. Hahahah...
