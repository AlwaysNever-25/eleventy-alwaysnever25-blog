I've worked on something for the last few days. No, not another project. It's just a training assignment for my finals, but it make me forget to update my blog for a bit.

I finished Imosae volume 7. It was... honestly very baffling how the series managed to blindside me with beautiful mix of poignant scenes, welcoming development, and fucking sex out of all things. I feel everything all at once reading this volume. It was very refreshing.

I also managed to get my hands on some physical volume today, courtesy of the book stores that I visited today. My family went on a whim and go to this mall, which I was okay with... but I had a mild discomfort in my stomach all the way through, which made it a pain for me to go along with them walking throughout the mall.

But I did end up going to the bookstore, and got myself the sixth and seventh volume of *Sachi-iro no One Room*, or *One Room of Happiness*. This is one of the series that I follow specifically only on physical, along with *Wotakoi* and one other series I haven't get my hands on (*Connect* by Suzuki Manatsu). The series are chugging along pretty well, with an addition of a new red-haired detective bringing discord to the interaction between Sachi (or xxx, her real name, still unknown) and the Kidnapper (we found out in volume 7 that he used to be called Haru, but this is still not his real name). I can't wait to save up some more money and get the rest of the volumes.

I also get my hands on *Pseudo Harem* volumes, but they're more for collection than anything, since I already finished reading them. They do still have some extra chapters that they don't scanlate online though... but yeah, I can't wait for the anime on this one. They announced them last year, airing this year. Excited!

Today I also managed to get ahead of my seasonal anime backlog, and watched *Solo Leveling*, *Frieren*, and *Dangers in My Heart*. Solid episodes all around, no complaints here from me. Even *Solo Leveling*, which was a bit of an eh for me for the first two ep, managed to get my attention this time. This sentiment is not shared by many though, which is fine. I was surprised myself that I am enjoying this, since they don't really follow the manhwa that closely (instead choosing to follow the novel and reordering some stuff). I can't believe they're only going to do one cour for this. It definitely needs another cour at least, a la *Dead Mount Death Play*.
