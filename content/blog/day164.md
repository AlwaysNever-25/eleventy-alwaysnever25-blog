Finally started to translate more of *Shadow*, something I've been meaning to do since [day 15](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day15/). I have six chapter at this time, but these chapters can definitely be expanded even more than it is...

Finished Charlotte today, and it was... an experience for sure. The lead up to the final episode is great, but I can't help but be disappointed by the final episode, even though it ties up everything neatly into a bow, cause I think this would be really great 24 episode anime if given chance, but they did what they can do with the amount of episode they are given... but still, I have to give it 7.8/10. Great if this is your first few anime, but once you watched tons of anime, it doesn't stand out amongst the crowd.

*Henjin no Salad Bowl* today (yes, *very* late cause I'm too busy with everything), we got Sara brainwashing children to say Watashi as *Warawa*, the birth of Grasshopper the Savior (my god they actually making that the band name), and Brenda starting the offensive on our clueless detective MC Sosuke... by asking the rival she doesn't know of, Haruka?! They are losing to the food made by Sara's friend Yuna though... 

Yomi Hirasaka how dare you make these lovely characters....

AND THEY'RE FROM AN UNTRANSLATED NOVEL SERIES TOO! IT'S UNFAIRRRRRRRRR
