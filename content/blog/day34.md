Today I spent the day mostly in bed, wasting (?) away the last of my short semester holiday. I had to once again take my sister to her zumba class like I do every saturday. I tried doing a Darkest Dungeon run but didn't get far... I also finished *Imosae* volume 10, and here's what I say on anilist about it:

finished volume 10.

Chihiro finally being the little sister was honestly a fucking treat :'D brings tears to my eyes. As expected though, such cuteness must be balanced as well... even though there are no apparent adverse effect on Itsuki after such reveal, at the end we found out that he was afflicted with writer's block after such shock. chihiro being his little sister after all brought him to his "senses", so to say.

he looked on his little sister obsessed work with disgust now that he actually have a little sister he wants to protect... compounded with the fact that his work is actually popular enough worldwide (not a household name, but he has made a name for himself), it was quite depressing to see that he lost his edge just as he reached the top, possibly the worst time to lose that fire in him.

I'm watching with interest (and by that, I mean I'm diving immediately to volume 11) as to how he'll get over this... and how bad the blowout going to be.

By night, I'm watching the last film in our great marathon of Christopher Nolan's movies, *Oppenheimer*.

Honestly, I watched this in the cinemas, and it's a classic. The soundtrack, once again by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, evokes the sense of scientific discovery and political intrigue that envelopes the movie throughout. Nolan managed to get me invested into a scientist burrowing his way through politics in his lab and in his own country, interspersing it (non-linearly, like he does usually) with the confirmation session of Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer's sworn enemy.

This is pretty high in my list, but since Nolan has a lot of good movies, it's not as high as it can be though.

Anyway, this viewing also coincide with the timing of my AMQ tournament qualifier, which doesn't need to be focused on since it's mostly for seeding the bracket used for the tournament, and separating brackets for novices and experts too.
