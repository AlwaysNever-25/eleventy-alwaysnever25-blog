*The Piggy-Bank Boy*. *The Dollar-Bill Man*. *The Stock Price Automaton*. *The Economic Gods*. *The Author vs Capitalism*.

Just a random idea I once again thought of during my ride back home, expanding on the Coin Guy idea I already had. I think that by exploring the limitation of having someone with explosive power but they can only do it on coins can be very fruitful. What would happen in a world where coins become something you're afraid to have? What would happen in the economy of a world where you cannot have change in form of coins? I want to see what happens there.

The sequels are loose ideas I had in my mind. A secret agent of sorts (possibly in the same world) who can use dollar bills as a nasty weapon. An AI whose purpose is to monitor stock price (un)expectedly gain sentience and began very slowly changing the data of the stocks they are monitoring to cause havoc. Greek mythological gods parody but it's all economic terms. The one to tie it all up, an author for all these books (it's meta, I meant it's gonna be me) fighting against the force of capitalism alongside his fictional-turned-real characters.

There were two friends who had a falling out. One is an alpha type, knows what they want, and the other is meek, typical of your MC in anime. Quote, "We're all protagonist of our own story. She just decided that I'm the antagonist in hers." Exploring the length people will go to ruin your life (kinda like the premise of the show 'Beef'), and how far someone will go to defend theirs.

Dunno if I put this here already but a romcom where two best friends finding out that they fall in love with the same person, who is oblivious to both of their attempts to reach them, so they both conspire with each other to see if they can make the person realize that they are being crushed on. Both the best friends and the person they like can be gender swapped. Can even be gender criss-crossed, even.
