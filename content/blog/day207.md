I have my AMQ match faster than I anticipated, so I wasn't able to prepare in time... not like it matters, since my enemy's list consist of 550+ completed animes, so it's futile to try and prepare for all of them.

I can only hope for the best, with all the ability that I have...

I lost. I did get much more songs than I anticipated, though, like finally recognizing *Haruhi Suzumiya* OP, or getting *Saint Seiya*, or finally getting the correct season for one of the *Sword Art Online* OPs... I progressed so far. But the barrier of entry for the tournament is still too high. I can only come back stronger the next time. The next time...

Today I went to make my passport, but turns out the system are no longer taking any stragglers that came in straight to the office, and we needed to sign in with a mobile app. So much for waking up early in the morning...

I also played more Amagami...

I also returned to playing some *ATRI* as well, and look at her go!

The story picks up as I finally get through some tender moments as Natsuki left ATRI with Catherine... before ATRI just wander off to see him anyway. God, ATRI, you dork. She even dropped Natsuki down to the sea when she attempted to help him get on the boat (depicted above).

Also, this humanoid robot is too cute, like... TOO cute. I can't...
