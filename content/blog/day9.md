I finished *Last Game*, a romance manga set in college about a rich boy trying to make his childhood friend, a stone cold airhead that doesn't understand feelings.

Compared to *Watari-kun*, this was a slightly better romance, but this time kinda limited by the source being old and kinda beat up, since this is a monthly series starting in 2011. Having them being legible in the first place is surprising in on itself.

Is it wrong to say that this is a shoujo manga with a guy being the shojo MC? Yanagi, the male MC, was the one fidgeting and trying for basically all throughout the manga, aware of romance tropes, heck, his reactions to the cool Kujou playing straight into a romance trope was definitely something you would see on a traditionally female character...

But he's still an ikemen. When he needs to be cool, goddamn does this dude can do it.
