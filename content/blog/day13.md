I spent the day sick again. I can't move my body, and it's all hot and stuff. The headache is back in force this time.

Wrote (I guess more like translating) *Shadow* story for a bit. I got up until the Second shadow. I think I'll carry on with translating this for the time being. I got up until the sixth shadow already, so it's pretty much a half-completed story. I rarely do this, usually my story are stuck in the first chapters. This is the only one that has progressed this far.
