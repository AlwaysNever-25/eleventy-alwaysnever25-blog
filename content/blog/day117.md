Turns out the only reason why I've been coasting so far with the exams is because the last exam took all the difficulty to itself, and fucked me up. Fucked the whole class up actually. This has been the hardest exam I've ever encountered while I am in this university. It brought me back to that time in my old university, where this kind of exam is something you'd see every semester. 

The dread I felt after every semester as I realized that I'm actually just not built for whatever hell they have for me... for this time though, the task is just incredibly hard. Even if I remembered all the formula I needed to use, the use case scenario demands us to actually understand what the formula is being used for, and they gave us some pretty nasty context, like the amount of inheritance someone would get if their uncle saved up for 30 years to buy a 10 million dollar mansion, while having a monthly compounding interest of 6% APR- yeah, I hope you understand how hard this was.

It's crazy though, this time I'm not so much despairing as I thought I would. I do understand what the exam questions are asking, I was just limited with the amount of things I don't remember, cause there's 5 questions that has subquestions, each has different formula to do it, and I feel like if I was able to remember them, I wouldn't be this fucked up.

Anyway, I'll probably have to redo this class over summer. Sigh...
