*Omniscient Reader* will get an anime adaptation... the news have been leaked since forever, but we finally get an official announcement... I don't know what to feel, we're already getting live action adaptation, and I feel like... like it all could just crumble down as everyone finally experience the story that I've been wanting them to experience, but they won't feel the same way...

Sigh...

Penultimate final exam... aced it... the topic that came out did surprise me because it basically is something that we didn't get to study that much, but I was able to go through it. I'm not going to hope for a high grade, but I feel like I've done pretty much all I can with this one, so whatever the score is, I'm happy. I'm content.

ZZZ stuff
</summary>
More ZZZ today, as we finally meet the girl I played this game for.

Meet Grace Howard.

<a href="https://imgur.com/ifQBlcF"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ifQBlcF.png" title="Grace Howard!" width="500px" alt="Grace Howard!"/></a>

I actually know her way before the game launches, as I saw one of her fanart floating around in my timeline. Specifically this fanart, that I found around [day 94](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day94/). I found out about her being a Zenless Zone Zero character around a month later, on [day 131](https://alwaysnever25-blog.netlify.app/blog/day131/).

Here are some moments when I found out about her and her name, caught on camera (my friend's name *graciously* censored).

Anyway, Grace is a mechanic hailing from the company Belobog Industries. She is the foster sister(?) of Koleda Belobog, the company's president, and she treats machines as if they were her kids.

Oh, I mean, her quirk aside, she is a capable mechanic, able to turn mindless machines into an autonomous mindful robot by maintaining their "logic cores".

Anyway, yeah, I didn't get her. I wanted to get her sooooo bad, but alas, it is not my time yet. 

We will meet again, after I get 300 rolls on my standard banner... or if I lose my 50/50 and somehow rolling you, Grace. Crossing my fingers.

*Tower of God Season 2* aired today, and holy shit... it's a different animation team, that's for sure. The OP... does not slap, but they definitely upped their action animation, that's for sure! They adapted pretty much faithfully this time around, but the pacing issue is still there... I don't know how else they gonna do this though, so I'm hoping that they continue this for the next few eps. The arc I'm most excited for them to adapt is in the next cour, but the fight that I'm excited to see is happening this cour. They better do it justice...

*Spy x Family Season 2* cruise arc has begun!

The arc is just as peak as when I read it in manga... the focus on Yor on this arc is something that I appreciate, as we get to see her in action, but also contemplating about her role as the soldier for her country... and also seeing Loid forcing himself to loosen up is fun XD and as always, Anya is Anya... all of them are a treat as always to watch.
