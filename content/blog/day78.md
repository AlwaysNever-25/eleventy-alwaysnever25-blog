Decided to boot up NIKKE again after so long... only because a *Re:Zero* collab is going to happen soon. I'm going to miss out on having *D* alter though... *D: Killer Wife*. What a shame, I like her roleplaying as a wife.

Anyway, it's Monday! The goddamn class I dreaded has reappeared after so long, the class where we have to bust our ass up to get through the assignment given during the day. Thankfully it's all group tasks, so we just split our progress. Unlike before though, where we take our time eating and stuff, we immediately work on it as soon as we get the assignment. Or at least I do.

Anyway, something else also happened today. Kinda made me rethink of my approach on the problem, and gives a better perspective on the problem as a whole instead of what I have conjured inside my mind.
