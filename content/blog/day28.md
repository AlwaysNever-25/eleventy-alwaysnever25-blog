I had to accompany my dad to get his laptop's Microsoft Word fixed today, which I was against but I can't really argue against his logic. I don't really have anything to do at home anyway...

At night, however, I dive down into the movie *Dunkirk*, following up from our previous day's groupwatch.

*Dunkirk* is a gripping movie about the real life event of the Evacuation of Dunkirk, something that happened early into World War II, where Britain have to pull back their soldiers from the beaches of Northern France whilst enemies are approaching from all sides.

From this movie again, Nolan employs the non-linearity that has become a staple for his story at this point. *Interstellar* have those in form of science fiction, *Inception* has them in terms of dreams, *The Prestige* have them in form of the three acts of magic, *Memento* basically have their entire story structure defined by being non-linear to immerse ourself into being Lenny, the anterograde amnesiac MC. *Dark Knight* trilogy have them (but definitely less than his other movies).

For *Dunkirk* specifically, we follow three separate act, all of which are happening in different time length. The story happening on Land, where foot soldiers desperately attempt to cut through lines to evacuate first, happening over the course of a week. The story on the Sea, where one civilian yacht captain along with his son and his hand braves the sea to help with the evacuation. The story of the Air, where three Spitfire pilots from the British Air Force covered the evacuations currently happening.

Once you realized the non-linear structure that he employed, you began to notice details that he put in. In the film, on parts about the Sea, the yacht captain saved a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy), who we then see on parts about the Land, helping people evacuate in the chaos, and interacting with the foot soldiers doing their best to survive. Other examples are like when one of the pilots have to ditch their planes into water, and his fellow pilots are unsure if he survive through the process, and have to move on to help with evacuation. We then see this pilot being saved by the yacht captain. 

There's many little details peppered through the movies that Nolan wrote and directed, and these kind of narrative techniques are so interesting, that I want to employ them to my own story. That's why I'm a big fan of him.
