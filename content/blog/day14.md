Officially published the website on Netlify... I still don't know what that really mean. So... is it now like, using Netlify's stuff instead of Github? Does that mean I can be more flexible in my website design? But to do what really? I'm still unsure about it all, I had to ask people to see if they understand it more than me, but to no avail.

Also there's something I didn't really talk about for the past couple of days. I noticed that my attendance for one course was in the red, and I was actually in trouble cause that means I can't attend my final exam, which means my score is guaranteed to be a fail. For the past few days now, this shit got me sick, to the point I can't even wake up from bed. Tomorrow is when I go back to university, so I'll have to get this shit sorted out then. Godspeed me.
