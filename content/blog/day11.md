Been really down the past few days, just sleeping on my bed. Before sleeping yesterday I forced myself to watch *Dead Mount Death Play* anime. Was not really the first thing on my list I have to watch, but I feel like it (this will be a common reoccurence throughout, so watch out).

Also Contracts update, I played a bit of *Darkest Dungeon*. Six hours in, and I'm not even close to finishing it, and I'm STILL at the easiest difficulty, trying things out. I need to speed things up.

I've downloaded the other two games, *Rise of Tomb Raider*, and *The Letter*, but I have not touched them. The only thing I did try was a few minutes of the first *Tomb Raider*, as part of my bid to overachieve on the *Rise* bounty.

I almost finished on *Magus*, stopping now because it was a good part to stop on the story, with some major reveal. I'll continue as soon as I am able to figure out what my contract review shape would be.

I checked out the first ten chapter of *Your Throne*. This will probably be the next thing I'm reading, probably when I'm feeling like it. I ended up reading the first four chapters of *Imosae* instead yesterday, so my sense of priority is already out of whack.
