Nevermind, did you know that CSGO (now CS2) cases, especially the older one, sell for really good price? I manage to sold some of my old cases to buy some stuff I've been eyeing for the past few sales...

And some new ones too, like *ATRI -My Dear Moments-*, which will get an anime next season! Insane that I managed to catch it just before it airs. I'm thinking of playing it before it finishes airing to compare not gonna lie... or even finish it before it starts airing? (kinda a pipe dream with *Biniku no Kaori* in my backpocket right now, and my finals coming up in a few days)

I'm at 12/18 on *Biniku no Kaori* now, with 10 bad endings and 2 good endings. The new "good" ending is just a bad ending recycled, and slapped with some of the previous good ending CG, which kinda makes me disappointed, but in the grand scheme of things, it's great that I don't have to go through a creative variation of the bad ending...

Anyway, looking at the guides, the last six ending requires me to really go deep into the story, so I've been binging this for a few hours. There are some twists and turns that I didn't expect, and some honest-to-god emotional scenes... that somehow is still very horny? How is this even possible?

Reading through these scenes though, I can see why this is very well regarded, at least. I was intrigued by the tropes but the writing itself is funny and dramatic that it keeps me invested in some way. The characters are all unique, even those characters that I hate doesn't seem to be as bad (except for the guys other than MC, they're all different form of asshole that I can't call them good). I didn't expect to like a VN this much... especially since this is a pickup I had during what I would probably call mania session (hyperactive session) but I'm committed to see this through. I'm thinking that I can get through this in a few days, but I might get stopped by my dad since he'll be bunking with me starting on Tuesday (or Monday, if they fast forwarded the renovation process), and I'm having my first final exams on Monday too.
