This post has spoilers to Roshidere volume 3. I implore you to read the series before reading what I have to think about it below, but in case you haven't, I've spoilered the review below... I'm just hoping it works.

<summary>Roshidere Volume 3 Thoughts</summary>
Finished Volume 3 of *Roshidere*. That was an exhilirating read, and they actually managed to shook my belief in Yuki now that she... did the thing. That was incredibly cruel move that she did, but it ends up activating Masachika's inner Kiyotaka, and I'm honestly surprised and very excited on how this development is going to go for the rest of the series. 

> "It's a weird feeling. Hard to describe it, to be honest. It's like... wanting to pet your cute little dog that is biting you but also wanting to ***discipline them*** so they *never* bite you again. Know what I mean?"
