Meeting few friends again... seems like my social life is restarting again after pandemic started.

It's raining today though, and it made me not go into the early class that starts in 7 am. The combination of the weather, and my lazy bum ass not waking up in the morning, creates the situation where I need to take it online instead.

Oh, I also finished Magus of the Library. Still can't finish Your Throne though, even the minimum. Now I'm certain I'm not the type of guy who excels with detailed plans. I don't like being pressured with plans...
