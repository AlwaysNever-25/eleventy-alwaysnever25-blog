Today I spent pretty much the day outside. Today is also the last day of class before we have another week break due to Chinese New Year and General Election coming up.

After the class is over (it's about IT governance... kinda boring, not going to lie.) I spent the next 8 hours in my friend's place. We hung out in an air-conditioned room, played games. It's been a while since I hung out on someone's room like that. The last time was during pandemic.

During our time there, I even get them to play AMQ with me, helping me trying to differentiate the opening for *Attack on Titan*, *My Hero Academia*, and somehow *Overlord*. I'll be having my AMQ match tomorrow, in the morning... so I'm going to try and prepare the best I can, even if I'm outside my home today.

After we spend the whole day together, we end the day by going out to a coffee shop in a place I used to go to meet my old friends from college. It was pretty lively, I even went inside a live bar (with bands playing) too. We didn't hang there for obvious reason, just wanna buy Takoyaki that shares a spot with the bar for some reason.

Anyway, we spend the night talking and talking, until close to midnight. It was pretty good. Tiring, but pretty good. I hope I wasn't checking my phone that much during our hangout. I'm pretty bad with that.
