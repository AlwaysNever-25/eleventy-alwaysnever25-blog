Today is D-Day. The reason why these cool peeps came here in the first place. To meet the captivating utaite, Ado.

Honestly, I never expected this to happen. Meeting someone you only know through online interactions? And you only met them after connecting with them through Discord Karaoke session? And then you entered an exclusive server of people in those sessions, and made friends with them over the past two years?

It's all so... unlikely to happen. All the instinct cultivated over my period of surfing the internet said that this is bad. There's already people putting up examples of how Discord meetups are terrible online, but it is in the context of a con, not a concert. It's just... I was expecting this to be a dud, like, they're going to rip me off or something (they might still do that, we still have a few days)... but I would gladly pay for my naivete if it means that I can continue hanging out with them.

I don't know if that means I'm just really that attached to them, or what... anyway, back to the concert.

The queue for concert merch already began way early in the morning, as I suspected. I asked my sister about this earlier, and she said that for performances like this, it's not unusual for people to be waiting even before the mall is opened. I was not able to join them in the queue early, because I was running a smokescreen op.

The op entails that I act like I'm going to my class, even though I do no such thing and join them in the queue for the merch.

After some shenanigans involving food and strict rules, we were unable to all be there to get our merch, so we have to rely on two of our friends already inside, in case this happens, to get merch for us. The rest of us then began waiting in the queue for the concert. Then something funny happened. I recognize people from my old uni queueing in the same line as us, and it was at that time that I realized that I'm not really as introverted as I am claiming to be, but I do still feel anxious of reconnecting with those people.

Bunch of thoughts came to my mind, but it was comforting to see that the cool peeps supported me. I... uhh... I am very attached to them. Okay, before I get all weepy about this...

At some point, though, the peeps who were buying merch was in line for the merch, but they were blindsided by the sudden change in rule about how they can only use cards that came from this country. 

Since the cool peeps are all from a different country, their card doesn't work, at least to get the merch. I had to cover for them, paying for about more than the price as the ticket to watch Ado in the first place.

My savings are NOT going to be fine after this, for sure, but I don't mind. This is potentially the first and last time they're coming here, so I'm ready to spend over half of my savings if needed.

After all that is over, we waited in the queue for hours. We hung out, talked, eat our food (at least the one I managed to salvage from the strict staff who took some of my food).

In the queue we received some freebies from members of Ado community here, which was surprising. I've never been to such concert before, so this was a first for me. I don't even know if this was something that happens for every artist, but... wow. The freebie is pretty high quality too.

Anyway, we also received stickers to paste on our phone, as they don't allow recording at all inside the venue, because of Ado's wishes. Ironically, her concert name is also "Wish"... heh. Honestly, I don't think they are this strict in any other concert, but I don't mind pasting my sticker over the camera.

Time passed. We ate our fill, waiting for the concert hall to open. One hour before the concert starts, we moved, and start filling in the concert hall, in an orderly manner. I'm surprised that we are all pretty chill, knowing how concertgoers can be, but it seems like us weebs are wiser than the normies... god, that's so cringe.

Once we get in, picking the best possible spot in my opinion, near the middle, but fifth row, waited again for half an hour, we were treated with... the nationalism that, of course, has to happen. Singing national anthem before we began the concert... wow. Much wow, very embarassing, but I sang my heart out.

OH SHIT ADO IS HERE. SHE'S IN A BOX CAGE AND WE CAN ONLY SEE HER SILHOUETTE HOLY SHIT SHE'S SO GOOD WHAT THE FUCK

My ears went deaf. Okay, not deaf, but definitely muffled. The concert is... the energy is so palpable. At some point, I don't care if my ears are getting stuffier, and I almost lost feelings to my legs, or my place shifting a bit.

ADO WAS SO GOOD LIVE. HOLY SHIT, SHE IS AN EVEN BETTER SINGER LIVE???? WHAT THE FUCK I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS.

Setlist goes like this, courtesy of someone online. I wouldn't remember this even if I tried, I was just feeling the vibes of the concert too much to remember.

- New Genesis: She started with one of her most recognizable song. I'm proud to say that I know her before she came out with One Piece: Film Red, but this is the song that propels her to became famous worldwide, in my opinion. And goddamn, the first time she appeared in silhouette, singing the song I know by heart (but maybe a bit wrong in lyrics here and there), it was so exhilirating. It's like I'm seeing a live action Uta singing just 15m away from me.

- Usseewa: Now THIS is the song that was her first step to popularity. Without this song, there is no chance that she'll sing in OP:Red, and all those other good songs are going to be gone. Honestly, with the amount of screaming she's done, I was so worried that she'll break her voice, but then I realized she has to do this AGAIN in the next month or so, for her world tour... she's honestly so fucking good holy shit. Her growl...

- Lucky Bruto: Ashamed to say that this song was something I didn't remember until the refrain. For most of this setlist, I know pretty much every part, or at least have a vibe to it, but I only heard this in passing, or maybe as an autoplay that doesn't register to me. The vibes was still immaculate though, everyone cheered for her pretty much throughout the song!

- Readymade: Jazzy vibes, I remember feeling very glad that I'm not a fake Ado fan and knowing a song that isn't something from OP:Red or one of her ultra popular one. Vibing real hard to it.

- Rebellion: Another song that I only managed to remember when the refrain pops up, but even less than Lucky Bruto for me. Probably the only song of her that I didn't check out before this, but that just means I am listening to it after this concert.

- Fleeting Lullaby: An Uta classic, Ado's cutesy dance and deep growl creates such gap that I was honestly shook.

- Motherland:

- Gira Gira: This song made me realize that I heard it first from the cover of Anya Melfissa, the Hololive Indonesia VTuber, and starting to wonder if there is at least ONE of them jamming it up here with us. I didn't really say it out loud though, and sang this one together with everyone here. We're all passionate about her songs, and this one used to be one my favorite song of hers before I listened to her other songs.

- Tot Musica: One of the cool peeps' favorite song, and one of OP:Red songs, it was honestly very chill inducing hearing her singing this live. All the chanting was warming me up for her ramp up in performance because-

- Aishite Aishite Aishite (Cover): HOLY FUCKING SHIT SHE WAS SO GOOD SINGING THIS LIVE. THIS SONG (both the original and Ado's cover, honestly anyone covering this) IS SO GOOD. I'M SHOOKETH. HOLY FUCKING SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

- I'm Invincible: HOW DO YOU IMPROVE ON AN ALREADY GOOD SONG? I'M IN DISBELIEF. 

- Ashura-chan:

- Kura Kura: A bit slower than the other, and bit more cutesy again, Kura Kura is an OP for Spy x Family season 2... that I only watched one episode of. Gonna need to get back to it, it was very bop though.

- Yoru no Pierrot:

- Kokoro to Iu Na no Fukakai:

- Stay With Me (cover): One of the cool peeps said that this song was a surprise, but in the Hong Kong concert a week or two before this, she sang this song as well, so I was not surprised at all to hear this. She never really cover this song online before, so this is my first time hearing her singing this. I am familiar with the song though, and her singing this was a blessing to my ears, for sure.

- Show: What else can I say about Show that wasn't already said. AM I READY FOR HER SHOW THOUGH? I AM. I'M JUMPING WITH JOY. Damn, what a good song this was live.

After Show, the show seems to be over, but of course, we demanded ENCORE! ENCORE! ENCORE!

It goes on for a long time, the shout for encore, and Ado provides us with the encore!

- Backlight: Coming in straight with the bopping Backlight, at this point I can already feel myself sweating, but I jumped with joy either way. This should be one of the last song from OP:Red that she is singing, since the other two songs are pretty slow and doesn't seem likely to be sung in this kind of atmosphere. It's a bit sad that I can't hear her singing "The World's Continuation", my favorite song of hers from OP:Red, but this is a concert, and I can get the decision on not doing so. All of the songs she picked so far has been high energy... how is she not break her voice doing this for two hours straight...

- Freedom: One of the song I am slightly familiar with, the way she sing it, and the energy she brings, is a lot lot lot different than just listening to her song on YouTube. We shouted so loud for this one, counting with her. At this point, I can really feel the energy sapping away from me, the adrenaline is already fading away, but I still shouted from the top of my head.

- Senbonzakura: This vocaloid cover is something that I barely recognized as well, being a deep cut origin of her utaite performances, this will be one of the songs I'll listen to after this concert over to immerse myself to Ado even more, just like Lucky Brute and Kokoro to Iu Na no Fukakai.

- Odo: What a fucking pick for the last song, by the way. Okay wait... let me say this again

# WHAT A FUCKING PICK FOR THE LAST SONG, HOLY FUCKING SHIT, LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
