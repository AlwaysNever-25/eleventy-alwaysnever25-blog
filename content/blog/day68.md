Watched Dune today, in preparation to watch Dune: Part Two in a few days. It's a really well made movie, with crazy twists, visuals, and get me really hype on watching the second part. I wouldn't be able to wait if I watched this when it was released. It took them *three years* to release the second part, that's insane. It's like watching *Spider-Verse: Across the Spider-Verse* all over again...

I can't wait for Paul to go Muad'dib all over Arrakis... I watched the trailers for *Part Two* already, so I know it's coming soon.
