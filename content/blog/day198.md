I binged through the manga version of *Chikan Otoko*... and holy shit... it's so good. The story gets crazier and developed into an actual romance situation that was so goated, I cannot believe this could happen in real life. Bro... the Molester Man is lucky as fuck. And Kansai... Loli Jugs... yeah, that's the name of the characters btw (they use pseudonyms).

This is an easy 9/10 from me.

I also made some comments about other playlist:

<details>
<summary><b>POV you are a vegetable. And you have adopted an angry cat</b></summary>

**Contractor:** xxxxxxxx<br>
**Fav Track:** **夢見るあの子は天国** & **放浪遊び**<br>
**Least Fav Track:** **乖離するゲンザイ  (Trust Me)**<br>

- **mon:** *What's that feeling? Like, seeing the sunset alone on a rooftop as the winds blew your hair away, like... you missed someone you only see in your dreams... like, you want to remember the words your mother told you before she left you for good? Yeah, this kinda evoke that feeling. It's short, sweet, and a great way to bring in the vibes to this playlist* 4/5
- **ザムザ (e remix):** *This feels like I'm dancing in the party organized by a couple of android goths and DJs, and I'm vibing to it, but then this yandere drags me to eat spiked apple together from a robot that opened their ribs, and we just live happily ever after in our delusions. Either way, the gothic influences paired with the classic vocaloid robotic sound just get me in the weirdest way* 4/5
- **I’ll Never Be (Apart From) You:** *Fast paced, just the way I like it, like I'm pacing around my room as my internet lagged out while I'm sending the assignment that is due in five minutes that I only managed to make within the past hour, whilst I'm on my second cup of coffee, and my conscience keeps telling me that you should've just done this days ago. Yeah. The internet lagging out part is the electronic drop, and the voice in my head is the singing part ofc, especially the bridge... insane song* 4/5
- **私は雨 (Watashi wa Ame):** *If you want to listen to a young girl personification of Rain speaking to you, staring you down with her dead eyes, you should watch this video... oh wait we're supposed to review the song too? Oh yeah, I cannot believe this isn't covered by any VTuber yet, or maybe they have and I'm missing out... the smooth sound of the singer (or vo in this case?) contrasts well with the sick beat and guitar riffs. This is bad, every song so far is so good* 4/5
- **夢見るあの子は天国:** *Whisper me over the cool beats and you'll get a gold star from me, the goddamn vibes from this short song holy- the beats just reverberate all over my brain it's so ticklish, the ASMR whisper also greatly enhance the experience...* 5/5
- **chainsaw attacks!:** *I'm happy as a CSM fan that this is in the playlist. Really got me feeling like I'm running to my burning house to save my PC, great ambiance and great track overall* 4/5
- **きみとくれないろ (Kimi to Kurenairo):** *Parts of the song reminds me of the Chainsmokers (in a good way I swear), I like the foot tapping, adding a lot to the experience, also is this a duet? The voice meshes well even if they're vocaloids* 4/5
- **乖離するゲンザイ  (Trust Me):** *I like the intermission at the middle of the song, but sadly that's all there is that caught my attention, it does feel like a nostalgic song that appeals to people that already knows the voice before, but it doesn't give me the same feeling* 3/5
- **ノマド (Nomad):** *I immensely enjoyed the tingly parts at the beginning and some parts throughout the song, and some part of the vocal background, the song doesn't give off the same vibe as the MV is telling me, but I do vibe with it... maybe not as much as I could* 3/5
- **Ethereal Mildness:** *Maybe I'm just a sucker for good soundtrack but this really takes me to the intro to a fantasy game (I mean, duh), or that feeling where you just found a new area after getting isekai'd...* 4/5
- **放浪遊び :** *Is that a bird? Is that a dissonant note in the background? No... it's perfection. Holy... holy shit, what is this song? Does this song made to tickle my ears? Insane production, probably gonna be relistening to this outside of contracts* 5/5
- **though I fear, I still walk:** *Immediately think this is Utada Hikaru vibes, a great closing to the playlist as the guitar riff brought us to a close...* 4/5

**Overall Thoughts:** This playlist reminds me of the first time I heard of Unison by Hoshou Marine, it's something so unique and ear tickling, that I can never forget it. Glad that this brought it back in some parts

**Final Score:** **48/60**

Also, the story gets deep as we have strife between Rosanna and Viper, alongside some deep talk between Maiden and Guilty (pictured below, from left to right, Guilty, Maiden) who might have a genuine friendship as they return to the Ark? Man, this story just keep on giving...
