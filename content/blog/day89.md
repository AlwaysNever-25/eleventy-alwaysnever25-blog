So today I spent too long of a time in *Star Rail Carnival*... ah yes, I forgot to tell! I went on the *Star Rail Carnival* yesterday as well, and today marks the third consecutive day I went there! I'm planning to go all the way, for all four days, so that I can maximize the freebie I get from this event. So far my haul is:

- Two Anniversary holographic tickets
- Welt Yang holographic Collectible Card
- Trailblazer Caelus holographic Collectible Card
- Trailblazer Stelle card holder (not a freebie)

Today's events are considerably more packed than the last two days, probably because it's Friday now, and more people have free time now compared to earlier days. For tomorrow I'm considering going even earlier than today... probably at 8 AM or so...

I've also worked on a script today, a python script to automate chapter page creation after a chapter is released. I am not used to Python syntax, my last time working on something python related was years ago, and it took me a while to finally get this script into working order. I had help from someone that I knew to get this script working, and I finally start reading API documentations to write a program... I can feel myself levelling up...

I also read some Roshidere LN today... the translations are most definitely MTL, or at least it was badly edited with poor punctuations and stuff, so I was a bit iffy, but I am pushing through. The dynamic between Alya and Masachika is pretty fun. This guy basically knew this ice cold princess fancies him since she kept saying stuff in Russian about it, and he secretly understood Russian.

Probably gonna read more while I wait in line tomorrow for the con.
