Woke up to "Not Like Us" by Kendrick today, this is insane... it's like he's celebrating over Drake's dead career...

mom's bday today, we get out to eat at a fancy place, nothing more to say. I didn't end up watching any *Chainsaw Man* today. Tried to watch ep 7 but I kept getting distracted by everything else...
