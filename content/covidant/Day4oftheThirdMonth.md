You know how it felt to feel nothing? 

....


Well, that's it.

I feel just the same as when Wanda felt nothing from the head of the Vision's corpse. I feel just like what there is before the space and time. I feel like the apparent state of my house right now. I feel like the time I've spent and the space I used are the same, amounted to almost nothing.

Nothing.

It's hard to say you know when you don't really mean it. You might know, but if you keep doing the same shit and get into the same mindset, you don't really know. You just claimed to. 

How many second chances must you burn before you realize you're out of second chances? You recognize the dire circumstance you are in right now, right? Your mom is out there in the hospital, just got out of surgery, and yet here you are, cannot even manage a simple thing called college.

A beautiful woman is waiting on you and news from you, but you can't even pick up the telephone to type it out. More people are waiting on you to help them, to a job you AGREED on doing but then ended up not doing. 

Why must you be like this? Why must I be like this? I keep asking those questions, the thoughts of those keep going around, and around, and around in this miasma of brain tethers of mine.

You keep going around to the same point, same behaviour, same mindset. When will you break out? When will you be gone and finally get out of the gravity of hopelessness and entrapment? To travel and experience the world as it is, not as you look on the blue screen that slowly corrupt your eyes and mind?

You say you're glad that you're not addicted to cigarettes, I say you're addicted, alright. Just not to smoking. That's why it's easier for you to not smoke, you already have an addiction. You lean on it, cause the alternative is you handling things, and you know you can't, or won't, handle it in the way it is supposed to or the way it should be.

You disgust me, I am disgusted of myself.

This kind of things is dangerous, but I keep doing it. I don't enjoy it, and it certainly didn't bring me joy, but why do I keep doing it? Why am I keeping things that I should've thrown away years ago? The books in my desk right now, those can be donated to a lot of people, or sold, and I can read digitally. 

The games I kept at my library, downloaded to my laptop, but I never actually played. Why?

You hoarder, you. 

You write these things and later you might just get a smidge of appreciation, maybe, that you kept going on and it led you to a better life. This was only a session of pure rage towards yourself, and you managed to handle it.

Good. Savor it. You deserve it. If you can handle this later in the future, you are ready to face the world, and possibly ready to become something more than just what you are today, what I am today.
