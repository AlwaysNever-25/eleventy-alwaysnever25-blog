The day of reckoning is coming. I am scared.

I have this new noise-cancelling headphone, it is effective. I am deafened while wearing this to any other noise. Also, I think this kinda cures my ringing noises shit too. All around, very useful, and very expensive. This will be taken away from me soon, so I'll enjoy it while it lasts.
