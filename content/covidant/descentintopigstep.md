The fight began anew,  
but I already stumbled.  
It's raining, I say.  
I'm too tired, I say.  
Yet I could just will myself awake,  
but I didn't.  

The blue ball smiled at me,  
menacingly, mockingly.  
It smiled for the battle I lost,  
it smiled as I throw it again,  
and again, and again, and again.  
Until my hands slipped and I failed.  

Again.  

I push myself to walk, and it hurts.  
Should I just stop then?  
I need to move, I can't just sit here.  
Even if it's to type these words.  
You see? I'm aware of it,  
but I didn't do anything.  
Everytime I tried, it wasn't enough.  

Fuck this life.  
Fuck this mind.  
Fuck this goddamn song in my head.  

All noise.  
Winds envelop me like I am nothing but leaf.  
I sway in the winds to the sound of the chorus,  
the madness.  
I said I can do this, I said I will do this.  
But where is the proof?  
Is it nothing but words?  
Is it just...  

Why?  
Why should I try then?  
A voice will say,   
"Because you'll feel silly afterwards if you didn't."  
I can't wait to get to that point.  
A point when I can look back, and wondered,  
why I'm thinking like this.  
Or as usual, I'll look back, and still think,  
I never really changed at all.  

Because this is me.  
I am this.  
Or can I be more?
