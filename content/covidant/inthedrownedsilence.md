In the drowned silence,  
I let myself lay.  
The dark waters around me,  
brought me down,  
and I closed my eyes.  
I can't see the light.  
It's ever fading, losing its brightness,  
or was it just me? Was it me who refused to see?  

It's okay to be sad, it's okay to be down  
but it's not okay to drown in it.  
But in the quiet water, I let myself go.  
Approaching the deep, the event horizon,  
but something will always kept me out.  
Cowardice? a hidden strength?  
Unwillingness?  
The voice that tethers you to the earth,  
the face that you adore and love,  
fades like the light you refuse to see.  

Maybe you can go on, maybe you can resurface,  
maybe you'll live and thought back,  
to this moment of weakness, and wondered why,  
you ever think about it like this.  
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.  
The war rages on inside,  
and the victor writes the story.  
And in the drowned silence,  
the victor wrote the tragedy.  

The self-hate thoughts, the self-sabotage,  
it's easy to say, fight through it,  
but the fact is, at some point, I feel like,  
I want to do it.  
I want to hate myself.  
I want to sabotage myself.   
I want to feel like this.  
The victor writes the story, and it is a tragedy.  
The fight continues on, day and day.  
You'll look back and see,  
why did you even think like this?  
You'll look back and see,  
how can you even write like this?  
You'll look back and see,  
that you're still just the same as this.  

And the water chokes you out, the water of thoughts  
in the drowned silence, you shake and shake,  
your chest tightens,  
you run out of breath,  
you filled yourself in, and you can't empty it.  
The water dragged you into the deep,  
but never quite deep.  
It wants you to live,  
cause it wants you to suffer.  
And the suffering ends when you reach the deep.  
and so it smartly tie you down, bring you up,  
then bring you down again.  

The light keeps fading but it never truly fade,  
like a loop at the end of time.  
In the drowned silence,  
I let myself lay.  
And the dark waters trapped me.  
I opened my eye.
