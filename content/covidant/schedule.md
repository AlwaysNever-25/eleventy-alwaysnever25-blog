I want to live. Is this vague? Yes.
I want to write. I want to keep writing. I want to do stuff that concern writing, or even editing. Is it worth it? I have to fight my dad for it. I have to have a long talk, but I know for sure that I would have to finish my degree, that is unavoidable.

What is my schedule to get to this vision?
TBD

negotiate with myself. don't shut him up, talk about it. don't keep it in. one is always better than zero, something is always better than nothing.
