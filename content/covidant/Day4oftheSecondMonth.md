Steadily gaining peace and feeling anxious.

tending for another IDLE game now, NGU IDLE. About to break through AVSP, don't forget to keep that shit up. Also, missed another tier 6 of CotLI's events, but seems like the crusader isn't that important. Hopefully that won't bite me in the ass later.

also holy shit SSD is the dopest shit ever
