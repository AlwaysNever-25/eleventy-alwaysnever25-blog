The year has been busy, so many things happened. Things that I am not sure I am proud of, but perhaps will lead to great heartbreak in the future. Finding new friends, both online and in real life. Moving forward with my life.

It is, however, marked by me not writing anything down about it, as I was "enjoying" my life too much to do so. It's not enjoyable, not everyday is sunshine, but there is always sun shining after a while. It is a process, a continuous fight, that I need to remind myself, that I cannot win permanently. I will fight, and I will win each time.

I just hope that if I do get battered, I can be strong enough to pick myself back up each time.
