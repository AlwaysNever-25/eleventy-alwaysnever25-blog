I've escaped 2021. Life sucked. Will it get better? I don't know. I tried making a habit of writing this shit, but it didn't work. Life gets worse. It started getting worse by March, and it didn't get better the more the years passed by. This December has been the worst month of my life, if only because of Verum and other information.
