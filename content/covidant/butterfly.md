The wings flutter in the wind,  
lightly flapping to keep them afloat.  
The flap however is weak, unnoticable,  
to any other being but other butterfly.  
It's running, from what?  

The creature pop its head from a nearby tree,  
its prey is slowing, and it started to smile.  
If a beak can smile, that is.  
It spreads its wings, feather beats the wind.
