You receive what you expect, and I expected the worst.

I don't blame them. A part of me, a selfish part that is most likely inherited from my father, is looking to blame anyone but myself. But I couldn't.

The mistake is very clear from the start. And even though the fact that we all share the blame, it still makes me not free from blame.

So I receive what I expected. Self-mock and self-disappointment.

The worst.
