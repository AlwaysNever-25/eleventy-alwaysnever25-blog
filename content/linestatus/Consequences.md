What happens when a part of you is determined to be a good boy, finish your degree, and do things nicely, but another part of you hate yourself, want to be lazy as fuck, and do whatever he wants?

I don't know myself. I desperately wanted to, but I don't. When I don't know shit about myself, I can't even begin to accept myself. And part of maturing is to accept yourself for who you are.

Instead I was this two sides raging on for control of this body, one is determined to be dilligent and the other wanted freedom. The freedom that was willingly given by my father.

I don't want to blame him either, it won't help. But I wanted to say for the record that I didn't want to move in the first place. God knows what would happen if I move to a foreign country. I'll be in a whole lot worse place than now.

Self-sabotage and self-destruct, is a part of depression. A fight I have to do each day, just to wake up and do your shit.
