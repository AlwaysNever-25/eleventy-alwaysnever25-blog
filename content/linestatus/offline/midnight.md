Blue ink on a white paper.

Mind think, tired, and wander.

Heavy is the burden,

feather is your weight.

Busy as you come,

all other needs forsaken.

Easy as it looks,

harder when you do.

Thoughts that come here should leave with an end.

The midnight sleep-less procrastination.

Let's hope you can survive for another day.
