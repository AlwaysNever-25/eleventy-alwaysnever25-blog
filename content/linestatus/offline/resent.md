I truly resent those who have not felt what I have felt.

To be the guy that got stepped on by your peers, the guy that people call attention seekers, and the guy that felt he was lost in the years of his life.

That is not what I have felt, that was merely what I have experienced.

What I felt is unique to my own, and even though anyone wanted to try as hard as possible to have sympathy for me, it still wouldn't made them felt what I have felt.

Resentful of those who seems to have their life under control. Resent those who seems truly happy when they have attention, and resent those that still give a smile when they know they were played.

This is not who I am, merely what I tried to be.

The Window of Johari clearly states that there are 4 areas to your personality. The personality that you know and people knows, the personality that you know but people don't know.

The personality that people know but you don't know, and the personality that both you and people don't know. These ares intrigue me because my personality seems to connect to every each one of these areas.
