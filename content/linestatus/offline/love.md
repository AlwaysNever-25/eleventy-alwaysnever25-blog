The black hair flows through my eyes, clouding my sense and pumped my hormones. The feeling is irrational, but I just can't help it.

The first one that my eyes catch on when I first entered this club. The girl that was secretly the biggest reason I wanted to go training everyday, other than thumping some drums.

Her pouting lips looms over my eyes like a lingering light after you were exposed to camera blitz, but it lingers longer and it never stopped lingering.

Her smile tidies over the swirling and chaotic mind of mine, pushes over every other negative and stressful thoughts, and made it all about her instead.

But the pretty girls got pretty, and the loser get nothing. The guy who can't do shit get no shit for him.

The loveless never finding love, cause he couldn't love.

Mood whiplash that took him for a ride, also apparent to his counterpart. Like a slave to her hormone as well, she wore her emotion in her sleeves.

It was more like in her forehead, because it's just so blatant you wouldn't miss it for the world.

When she was not feeling like she would do something, you can tell. When she was kind of mad because of something you could tell.

The only hard thing was to not get my hopes up, because it seems like that was what I'm always doing everytime I fall for someone.
