What did I do for a year? Doing absolutely nothing. Cutting off with the group I'm supposed to lead, stumble and fumble my way to keep my GPA above 3 and joining well established group after they went through the year together.

I felt like an intruder.

They have cohesion before, friendship. I can only imagine that it was kind of broken by the time I came there. There is still some people, but most of them are gone.

The same fate that happened to my previous group, but instead I am the one who leave instead of the one who stayed.

I'm only in this new group to fill the gaps, the late comer. The desperate attempt to mend what was kind of broken already.

Me. The joker who jokes about everything like he was a fucking child. Trying really hard to get into their good grace, unknowingly.

It felt really hard to ignore those feeling, at first. Being left out. Like they gone through something together and I'm not there. I'm only here recently and being that new guy.

It's still hard, but not as much now. I think.

It's really not just me that is kinda new here. There are other people, younger people. But they know they are foreign. I'm more in the middle, but looking to stay in one side instead of the other.
