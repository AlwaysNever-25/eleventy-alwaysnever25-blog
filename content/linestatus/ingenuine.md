Ingenuine;
Not yet an actual word. Incorrectly used when trying to describe something that is the opposite of "genuine".

Usually confused with "Ingenious" which means "gullible" and "Ingenuity" which means "inventive originality".

It is best to use the word "disingenuous" when you are vying for the antonym of "genuine".

(taken from the urban dictionary on the meaning of "ingenuine")

To be fair, I do want the title to be Disingenuous. But the running theme of the status starting with "in" is just too good to be broken. Perhaps later.

That's what I felt lately. I did not know whether or not I am really not genuine with my talk or that's what actually the deepest thing that I have on my subconscious being brought up suddenly during this midnight talk, but I do note that I felt like I was duplicitous during that time.

Heck, I even start questioning my whole life. Whether or not I have been actually not deceitful in everything I did.

I am scared that I lie to myself and to others so often that I cannot even began to tell which is the fact and which is the lie.

I don't even know if I'm being genuine right now, when I'm writing this.
