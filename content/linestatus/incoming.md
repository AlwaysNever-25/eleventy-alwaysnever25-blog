The damn performance is done, no more training until late night. No more sleeping at midnight everyday. No more hearing the same mistake happened and the same song stuck inside my head again.

Now I only have to wait for the incoming trouble.

It's already starting. Because I was too overwhelmed in the past 2 days, I forgot to create a story for my proposed concept for a competition.

I also forgot to make some assignments for some of my lessons, and I felt my body starting to tire again and again after doing absolutely nothing.

I also spend so much money on the first days of the month and forgot to save a bit.

One mountain overcomed, the next one incoming.
