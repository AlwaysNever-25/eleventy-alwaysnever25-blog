I'm trailing behind.

My peers around me started to know things that I don't, and they started doing things that I can't even begin to understand.

They started to close off their generosity, and leaving everyone behind. Their focus is forward, and I was left focusing to my left and right.

The world is not the kind of place where everyone moves together in one step., but I dearly wished it was.

The stories I read about true friends that would do anything to each other... Perhaps this is the time when I have to stop wondering and start managing expectations.

The world doesn't revolve around me, I'm not the fucking sun. It moves around and if I just stayed put and kept wondering where would I finally start to get ahead, I'll be left behind.

I'll be trailing behind them like a stalker.
