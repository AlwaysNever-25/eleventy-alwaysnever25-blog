The history goes back, and the time stand to witness. That I was there during the time of transition.

During my elementary school years.

My school merged class with a neighbouring, similar school. The transition to the new class, at the time, were kind of shocking to me. Things can change in an instant, I realized.

During my Junior High School.

I was there during the days when they have a place to pray near the gate of school. I was there when it was torn down. I was there when they build a new building out of the empty space. Our old buildings were torn down, we moved our class to this new building.

Class was divided into 3 section of time.

The freshmen were moved to a nearby elementary school and they temporarily starts school at noon after the elementary students finished their class.

The junior and senior takes place in the new building, but in different times. The seniors (my year at the time) goes as usual in the morning. Class break were shortened, and we go home earlier than usual. After our classes ended, the juniors goes to the class.

Needless to say when I recently go back to my old school when I was on a holiday, I was kinda pissed that it look much, much better than during my transition days.

Transitions that was that magnitude were never felt again afterwards, cause I entered one of the most backassward High School in the country. 

I entered straight after a scandal rocked the entire school to the ground. Rules were changed, new principals were shuffled.

And the student left ruffled, unsure what to do. Rules were enforced, and I felt the grime that the real world bring here. The backstabbing, scandals, and how people will go at length to bring someone down.

And that was what happened now. I entered the faculty during its transition to independency, just like my transition from a sheltered life back at the capital, to a city a thousand kilometers away to became an independent college student... ish.
