This is nothing new, and I should have expected it.

We sat here in the night, under a big tree, bitten by mosquiots on any skin exposed. We sat there and was *gently* reprimanded for faults that might or might not mostly be ours.

How can we care about people that might or might not care about us?

How can we start thinking for people that might or might not thinking about us?

How can we find a solution for a problem when you keep highlighting any problem that we have and focused on that?

I sat here fighting the urge to close my eyes as their eyes, their overbearing eyes, starting to sap my strength.

We were here thinking of ways to indirectly compliments them. About how this 'event' they do for the last year have meaning to each of us. How they changed us by doing what they do, even if we did it involuntarily.

Might as well just ask for a direct compliment.
