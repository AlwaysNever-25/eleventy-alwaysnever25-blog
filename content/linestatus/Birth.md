(This was originally intended to be written for my birthday but ended up being written the next month.)

The eyes open up to see the ceiling of a room. There is a lamp there. He feel the warmth inside the room, probably the thing that woke him up.

It was only years later that he recognized that he'll wake up when the room became too warm, but that's later.

He rise from the bed where he sleeps and go to the dining room. He played his toys there along with a blue chair that he imagined as something.

The vagueness of the sentences there is because that was his first memory. The earliest memory of his life that he could remember, since his birth to this life. Anything earlier than this, he only know from their parents.

The cigarette that burned, touched a skin so that it could stop burning.

Repressed memories.

Memory, what a funny thing. When you want to remember it, you wouldn't remember it. But when you don't want to remember it, it'll come like an unwanted thing.

Not a repressed memories though, this memory wouldn't come in a usual way. No matter how hard you try to remember it, you wouldn't remember it. Not unless you worked out what made you repress it in the first place.
