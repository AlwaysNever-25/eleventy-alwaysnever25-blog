Today is a sunday, still a sunday. The end of the week, and also the end of me stopping myself.

From hoping.

I let myself hear the beat of my heart and follow through what it signify. I let myself believe that I can love. I let myself believe that I deserved to be loved. I let myself hope again.

Gone were the days that I approach things cautiously. I was all up for it, but I can't do that to someone else. Leaving it hanging, unclear over what we are. 

I let my heart that beats severely over my chests guides my words, and let myself be happy once more.

Thank you sincerely, for helping me find my courage, to hope and to motivate, and also to love again.

The chains that supposed to go away 2 years back, unlocked and abandoned but yet still exists and binds me inside, now gone like all the thoughts that had kept me back.

ðŸ˜Š.
