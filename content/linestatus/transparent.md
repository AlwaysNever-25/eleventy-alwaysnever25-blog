Transparent towards the people that you lead will lead to the people transparent towards you.

Let the message clear, let the announcement steer, and most of all don't keep any secret you fear.

We fought through this shit for 1.5 year, and maybe we weren't that transparent at first. But in order to succeed, you must be transparent.

Let all your opinion out, don't hesitate. Don't think that your opinion doesn't matter. It matters a lot.

It can help the people that lead you to understand in what state does the community is at. It can help him make decisions that might be amiable to everyone's opinions.

It also help to clear your heart from the cluttered mess that is the desire to keep it secret.

So be transparent, be real, be honest. Because they don't need to see your lies, they just want to know your truth.
