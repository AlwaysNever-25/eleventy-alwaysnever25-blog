Like a former drug addict that got lured back, I felt like I was in a relapse.

Addiction of those thing slowly eats me down. Sacrificing everything just for a few minutes of interaction with it.

It's not a high that I felt, that's for sure. It was a bottomless well of needs that I can't possibly fill.

As soon as I ran out of interesting things to watch or see, I search for more. The last thing I wanted is to stuck in a boredom.

I was unconsciously wasting my time, in a vain attempt to taste just a bit of stimuli so that I won't feel bored.

All those lesson earlier last month was thrown away in a sea of addicting things to consume, as I waste away my minds, my energy, and my time to meaningless, menial, and most definitely morose things out of the Internet.
