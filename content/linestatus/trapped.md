We are the slaves of our own emotion. We are trapped to act according to our own emotions.

I hate that, I always hated that. I just wanted to be happy all the times, just like Joy from Inside Out. But I understand the need to be sad at times.

Angry at times.

I was a coward, yes. I once challenged a guy to a fight and came home with injuries that is not visible to the surface, because I am not going to make my parent worries about me.

My parent's worry became a trap for my whole life. I started withholding actions taht sometimes my emotiosn makes me want to do, just because I hate and I don't want to see my parents worry.

I hide every emotion-like actions that I'm about to do and because of that I used to have a lot of emotional outburst at the very worst of times.

College helps me control the timing of the outburst, because I have my own room to myself sometimes. It was harder to find some solace in school, because there aren't a lot of place where you can be alone.

The fact that my parents are more than a thousand kilometers away from me also helped. Not without its own disadvantage of needing to hide that I missed them sometimes.
